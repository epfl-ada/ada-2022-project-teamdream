Not much in the way of a head reaching up through it at all, in fact it was rather lifeless on the first pour, though the second got a bit better. Nice side glass lacing towards then end and some moderate carbonation coming up through it.The aroma was sweet, nice touches of caramel malts and an almost candy like sweetness that was wrapped up nicely in a bit of a grassy, earthy, hop like nose. The flavor was more of the same, but I have to admit I am impressed here with this. Lots of alcohol in the flavor here, a bit of a hotness that I have not seen in the rest of the their beers. Lots of grainy malts, touches of light caramel and a mostly understated hop flavor. Lingering taste of hot alcohol and grain left me hanging again as well as I really was expecting more from this here. then the hops come in and balance and smooth it right over. very nicely done",

The coffee still has considerable acidity, probably strengthened by the blueberry, but I somehow don't mind. The chocolate malt pops up again late palate. Sweet, not overly so.

Backstory I thought this was awesome when I first tried it whenever it came out, and then saw it for like $12 at Costco and bought a bunch. This was bottled about a year and a half ago, and been in a basement for at least a year.Slightly darker than a gueze, and based on legs you can guess there's about double the alcohol. Super fruity on the nose, white grapes and pear. It's not as purely funky as a gueze, but it's almost like a gueze on steroids. Really glad I have a bunch more of these. Extremely sour, slick mouthfeel from the alcohol. I think the LC's with Flemish/Flander's style ale, and high % bourbon barrels, have way too much &quot;sweet and sour sauce&quot; flavors. This clearly blonde ale/heavy on wheat, and no bourbon. I can't have hoped for more in this bottle, and I'm delighted I have several more. While this isn't as delicately funky or refreshingly dry as gueze and beers meant to mimic them like Beat/Le Roar Grrrz/Allagash Coolship, this an amped up bigger American version with tons of grape and stone fruit notes, huge mouthfeel from the alcohol, and a puckering taste that finishes clean dry. I typically do not care for high abv sours, but this and Sour Monkey are amazing, this being slightly more complex with the partial barrel aging.",

This DIPA is brewed with Mosaic, Citra, Centennial and Columbus hops.Double Actuator DIPA pours a clear to slightly hazy, coppery orange with moderate carbonation.  2 fingers of ecru foam.  Excellent lacing.  The smell is bursting with sweet orange, grapefruit, pine and caramel malt.  The taste starts with orange and grapefruit, followed immediately by the resinous pine, all against the moderate caramel malt backbone.  The alcohol warms the mixture, complimenting the malt backbone.Double Actuator DIPA is really good.  Its standouts are its smoothness and how well-balanced its flavors are.  Kudos to Bottle Logic.

That's about it.T - Sweet, citrusy maltiness with hints of lemon that lasts all the way until it hits the back of the tongue where the hops finally lend a hit of bittering -- but not much.

Pretty unique, I really like the nose.The palate opens with a blend of brine and peat, both mellow, but both still the most dominant flavors in this rather mildly flavored brew. This is followed by toffee, burnt sugar and a mild yeasty fruitiness. Oxidation is unbelievably low here, this smells and tastes remarkably fresh (fresher than the 07 Speedway that preceded this it). Drying and mildly smoky on the finish, this beer is pretty excellent. Medium in body and a touch over-carbonated for my palate, this is rather stunningly good.

The notes of key lime are distinguishable, and are a nice twist to this pale ale. Taste: believe it. Little Creatures is very pleasant beer to drink on. It's got lime, a little squeeze of lemon, a crush of caramel, all while being well balanced. And it's very laid back. A mixed fruit note appears as the beer warms, but the beer is already a good one.

Deep roasted flavors bite at your tongue, like black coffee, dark chocolate, sweet and bitter roasted malts, high alpha hops, toffee, and dark toast.

Some alcohol warming was present after consumption. This one was heading toward and Imperial Oktoberfest, but still remained a nice beer.Pint at the Flying Saucer in Charlotte.",

The aroma is nothing but well thought out citrus characters. The Flavor is nothing shy of exceptional, as it first hits the tongue with a citrusy delight, and lingers for a while and finishes off with a floral quality that blends nicely with the subtle sweetness that the Honey in this master piece adds. The Body has been well designed to match the multitude of hop characteristics that mingle in this beer. Cheers to the brewers at Bell's for once again amazing me with this beer.

It looks like this beer will be a big improvement on Anvil's Biere d' Saison! Sweet caramel malt, honey, nutty toasted malts and a lovely floral hop note make up the majority of the nose, with fruity tones and a hint of spice also being noted.

The flavour not quite as full as the nose, but is nonetheless very enjoyable. The initial flavour is quite sweet with notes of honey and caramel malt. Nutty, toasted malt and floral English hops make up the rest of the flavour. The finish is very lightly bitter and does just enough to balance the initial sweetness.

Never had this before and I haven't had an Old Ale in quite some time and even though I've been reviewing beers on here for years, bottles like this always throw me for a loop. There's a *lot* going on here and although that's not a bad thing, it can overwhelm the taste buds pretty easily. Very complex and strong, this was an Old Ale that was true to form.This had a very dark brown hue with a hint of plum tint to it, with strong carbonation and a fluffy head that quickly settled down. Lots of bread and dark fruit in the nose, reinforced by currant, booze, and yeast in the taste. Some brown sugar sweetness and fig was underneath everything but the overall taste was that of a highly fermented apple cider. Sweet, malty, and potent, this packed quite a punch even though the warming effect really wasn't there. A bit more sweet or potent and this could have been a Barleywine. A bit more wheat and it could have been a Dark Wheat Ale or Dunkelweizen. A bit more fruit and this would have been a true fall seasonal with pear and grape notes. As it was, this was the epitome of what an Old Ale should be, given that other years reviewed on here had varying tasting profiles, like a Lambic. Strong this felt and strong this was but that didn't detract from the profile or drinkability of this beer. The yeast and fruit flavors lingered beautifully long after the liquid went down and there was enough malt her to make this full but just short of feeling cloying or chewy. Short of having too much grain or rye, this beer nailed what an Old Ale should be and in terms of quality, stands toe-to-toe with the Old Rasputin. An outstanding offering and the example of why brewers should add an Old Ale to their portfolio. Complexity is rarely more enjoyable than this.",

Smell: Huge hop assualt with perfume and flowers, citrus zest, and grapefruit rind. Visceral as hell, but balanced nicely with the malt flavors, adding a bit of sweetness, and rounding it off with some earthiness, bark, and woodiness. Taste: I love the finish best, which is insanely long, lingering, and ridiculously complex, with lots of grains, earthiness, and flowery hops. But initially it's the citrus hops, the nice malty flavors balanced out by the hop bitterness, sour cherries, sweet strawberry, orange peel, and bitter rind flavors. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, creamy, and full, without the sticky or cloying sap feel to it in the least. Drinkability: I think I echo what a lot of folks have said: Breckenridge brews this beer? But I think it goes for a lot of breweries these days, which is brew better and make less. Most of us will pay the money for it, it's more complex, and there's much more to offer. It's a pretty expensive 6-pack, but again, worth it, and pretty damn good comparably with many of the DIPAs out there. And there are always the bombers if you can find them, if you don't want to commit. I have one that's been cellaring -- when I actually believed that DIPAs get better with age -- that I'm now not extremely anxious to try, and I'll review it when I do.

Roasted barley, dark chocolate and roasted coffee come out following the nose, but again I wouldn't know the apples and cinnamon were there if I wasn't told that they were. The bar mistakenly labelled this as a 4.5% ABV beer, so I was drinking it thinking it was an ordinary stout rather than an Imperial. As such, I was thinking &quot;This is a flavorful standard stout,&quot; but really I should've been thinking &quot;This is a mildly flavored Imperial stout!&quot;Feel: medium full bodied, moderately carbonated, a little creamy, no alcohol bite. Drink: very drinkable Imperial stout. Drinks more like a standard stout than an Imperial.Overall, a decent beer. Its flavorful but its missing some things you might want to look for in an Imperial stout, like alcohol and some dark fruity flavors. Its a great effort from a new, emerging brewery and they definitely have promise. I would give this a try if I saw it on tap but don't think I'd seek it out.",

        "text": "Purchased at City Beer Store, San Francisco. Batch #210. Brewed 20.01.09.This is a big imperial stout brewed by the Norse HaandBryggeriet and recently bottled for the first time (or so I've read). They call it a Dark Norse Ale and brewed it with Brettanomyces clausenii, lending a sour flavor unique to imperial stouts, in my experience.The beer pours opaquely black with a dark brown head. It's one of the darkest heads that I've ever seen on a beer.HaandBryggeriet nailed the imperial stout aroma. There are richly roasted malt notes of chocolate and coffee. Alcohol rears its head a bit, but it's a welcome addition on a big beer. There is a touch of oakiness that you pick up in the nose more after you taste it. Some sort of hoppiness is lurking underneath, but it's definitely not the star of the show. The brett doesn't really emerge in the aroma; the other smells are probably a bit too strong and rich for its relatively delicate character. That said, it really nails imperial stout for my money. I imagine it will grow a bit more floral and fruity as time passes for a cellared bottle. Dark stone fruits, plums, cherries, lurk beneath the waves of roasted malt.The flavor is deep, dark and interesting. The roasted malt is strong and rich. There are notes of bitter, oily coffee beans, dark chocolate and burnt caramel. I believe that the beer is aged on oak (as are many of the beers from this brewer) as there is an apparent oaken dryness that screams fancy Russian Imperial Stout. The brett brings everything together with a round, fruity sourness that shines through the high alcohol content. It's not a strong brett flavor, but it's there and it's very interesting in the big, delicious stout. I can imagine this beer aging incredibly as sweet, dark stone fruit flavors develop from the roasted malt and complex yeast. The alcohol will calm down a bit, as it is still drinking a bit hot. Clearly, the alcohol presence didn't take away from my enjoyment of the beer.The feel is a bit rough on the palate, but it will mellow and it's such a great, big flavor that I'm willing to forgive the current faults. The drinkability will also improve for similar reasons. I wish that I could afford a case of this beer for the cellar. This is a phenomenal beer. If you see it, tough out the price and grab some bottles. A big, delicious imperial stout brewed with brett sounds like a lock for aging.",

An off-white head covers the top and stands about a finger and a half tall. It\u2019s quick to dissipate and leaves a sticky web of lace trailing down the glass.The nose is very impressive. It\u2019s definitely hoppy. Strong citric hop notes of orange and grapefruit are noted. There are also some piney and light floral hop scents. It\u2019s a rather diverse mix. There are some malty notes in the mix, but they take a back seat to the hops. I like it. The malt base is somewhat bread-like and candied. There might be a light caramel scent there, but it\u2019s not much. Very interesting. Alcohol is blended extremely well. The flavor is quite good, but isn\u2019t quite as good as the nose. The malt base has a cracker vibe to it and is sweet and sugary. There\u2019s a little caramel, but it\u2019s quite restrained and mild. Nice. Hops emerge quickly and add a citric grapefruit and orange flavor. Piney and floral flavors are also noted. I like the profile, whatever it is. It\u2019s bitter and dry, but isn\u2019t palate wrecking. Alcohol isn\u2019t much of a factor at all. It\u2019s masked very well. Finishes hoppy and dry.

        "text": "Theres no question about it, I love the beers that comes out from the Stone Brewery in Escondido California, and I love their passion and unique enthusiasm for amazing beer. Among their most unique is the Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale, which also happens to be one of the coolest beers I've yet to come by. It is a black India Pale Ale.Your typical IPA is golden yellow to amber in color, transparent to hazy and opaque, with crisp pale malts and a fresh bite of citrus, earthy or piney hops. This Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA is pitch black! Literally, it is completely black letting not an ounce of light through it. Somehow the maniacs at Stone have crafted an IPA that still exemplifies so many IPA characteristics in an astounding fashion, yet is dark as night and creamy as sin.This is one of the many reasons why I adore this brewery. They refuse to limit themselves to what is seemingly the standard and open their minds to a new world of flavor, color, and aroma combinations.It was originally brewed as their eleventh anniversary ale (see the original bottle below). By the time that the original batch had sold out, they had received such a strong sentiment from beer drinkers, and they missed enjoying the beer so much that they decided to add it to their regular beer lineup. Thanks guys!It is brewed with a combination of pale and roasted malts, has been bitter hopped with Chinook hops, and flavor as well as dry hopped with Simcoe and Amarillo hops. On the back of the bottle the brewery claims that they know exactly how amazing that this beer is, and they don't care what anyone else may think of it. They know that they are artists and have created a masterpiece, and hence have named it Sublimely Self-Righteous.It is available in 650ml bottles, and is 8.7% abv measuring 90 IBUs (International Bitter Units) - so it does fit the bill for a strong IPA. I wasn't sure what temperature to enjoy this beer at cause of its mixed heritage, so I decided to err on the IPA side of things. I brought it out slightly warmer than fridge temperature around 5 degrees Celsius (40F). It pours smooth and creamy like a stout raising a soft and dense one inch tan khaki head. The beer is deep black and fully opaque. Only when I hold it up to direct light does a slight bronze hue gleam through.So far its more stout than IPA, but the nose is all pale ale here. Fresh American west coast hops pour out with grapefruit, pine needs, earth and pineapple. In the middle behind the hops are mild roasted malts and soft coffee aromas. It was odd to smell these two extremes together, but they seemed to work exceptionally well.Getting into this beer was so awesome - first its glides over your palate with smooth creamy stout flavors. Roasted malts, light bitter chocolate, coffee, earth with a nice soft bittersweet character. But in a beat comes the crashing and quenching parade of hops. Piney fresh grapefruit, lemon peel, glass and spice begins to rush past your tongue making their mark on your cheeks and throat. Pale malts show light sweetness in the center, but are primarily dominated by smooth roasted malts and espresso.The body is supremely smooth, elegant and refreshing. Stone really hit the nail on the head with this one. While it comes in smooth and luscious, it finishes crisp and clean completely refreshing your palate. This could be such an amazing beer with a huge range of foods! Spicy, grilled and roasted meats will do amazing. Rich chocolate deserts and fatty soft cheeses will be beautiful. But really, all I want to do is enjoy this beer on its own. I'm a little sad that Stone is so far away, and I constantly debate with my roommate over what beer if any beer I could choose to be regularly available in Toronto would be. Time and time again, I end of with this black magic work of art.",

Leaves a whole lotta lace too.Aroma is far from typical for an IPA: immediately after the pour the head brings up fruity, flowery and perfume-y scents, but then a boatload of butterscotch and toffee take over. Definitely not a hops-centric aroma, surprisingly enough. Yeast seems to impart some unusual notes, and though I like what I'm smelling, I'm unclear how to rate it, considering the style. I appreciate iconoclastic brewers and the blurring of styles, so I'm going to rate it on the higher end, style be damned.So the flavor unveils some hops, but they're not quite as front and center as your typical IPA. Buttery slick texture plays along well with the candy-like butter flavor. It's like a butterscotch candy with a smidgen of hops and alcohol warmth tossed in for the adults. It borders on decadent, in terms of it's candy-ness. Yet it's also not cloyingly sweet. The sweet malty center in this very interesting IPA dances around with the hops, and you get a good balance of sweet malts and grassy bitterness in the finish. The texture mingles well with the flavor, suitably syrupy and buttery with just enough carbonation to make you feel it.The back of the bottle notes they were attempting to replicate &quot;some of the very special brews created by the early Virginia brewers,&quot; so style-nazis should probably cut them a little slack, as things were probably quite different in the early 19th century, IPA-wise.

Maybe I wish the coffee was a little more expressive, but it's still definitely there, and it's tasty. With the more subtle coffee, I get some more interesting flavors underneath, roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate alongside chocolate syrup, some earthy nuttiness, and maybe a little bit of caramel sweetness. This is medium bodied, a tiny bit thin. The lighter body keeps it very drinkable. There's a normal level of carbonation for the style and strength.This is a good little porter, nothing crazy or out of this world, but very tasty and gets the job done.",

The aroma feathers a light malt and grain earthiness, mildly sweet and vaguely musty. A distant toffee note precedes a more strident air of alcohol. The tiniest touch of hops flirsts, then passes. Upon tasting, it's lightly toasted and roundly fruity, but it's all about malted grain, deeply sweet and boasting caramel, berry, and vanilla. A crisp edge of brown sugar is soon blunted by an understated spiciness and drying alcohol. A thinner version of the maltiness returns near the close before a muted peppery bitterness lingers a bit. The dense malt gives it a basic, rich profile. Full bodied, a flash of syrupy sweetness cloys pleasantly on the tongue. I drank this with no preconceptions, but I was still surprised by the muscular malt character. Sure, there is a touch of peppery spice, but it's the grain at the fore. Balance is not the way here, nor should it be. A strapping ABV is wide open and mighty warming, and a caution if there ever was one. Still, while one is the wisest choice, it's one that does itself reasonably proud.",

Aroma is a whole lot of malts with a medley of different roasted and toasted qualities and bready things and whole grain goodness; cookies too with slight chocolate. A rich and inviting, mild mostly but very inticing to beer to wiff. Taste is a nice mix of complex malts bringing in lots of the same things from the smell. Roasty, toasty, caramel, molasses bits, whole grain, bready goodness. Reminded me of some of the fuller and richer Vienna style lagers out there. Its not like a any other porter I've had. It's actually quite mild, but the complexities to the breads and grains along with noted mixures of herbal grassy hops, chocolate, and earthy things makes this really nice to let roll around for a bit. Feel is about medium bodied, crisp and roasty/toasty warm, slightly creamy, a tad buttered bready-like, which is nice. This is an interesting porter, very malt laden with a roastier then normal, apposed to sweeter malt approach. And at only 4% these can go down real easy.",

Nice 1&quot; fine bubbled tan head that drops quickly to a nice cap that is maintained by the high carbonation. A few splotches of lace hang on to the glass. The first impression on the nose is the yeast. Dark fruits and raisins. Caramel maltyness kicks in on the first taste but it is surprisingly dry. The finish is beyond dry and smooth, not sure if it's the carbonation level or what but this finishes like a dry merlot. Some plum and cherries slip into the taste.So does it live up to the hype? I'm not sure but it is a great beer no matter how you look at it. This one shows that you don't have to be over the top with ABV or IBU to be world class. Very understated and solid in every aspect.

A fluffy one-finger head of cocoa powder remains as thin, silky top layer. Super sweet and fruity nose. Dark cherries, toasted coconut, molasses, maple, vanilla. Hot damn, this is delicious. I don\u2019t know how the brewers at FiftyFifty managed to pull such magnificent flavors out of such sub-par bourbon, but this is exquisite. Again with the dark cherries, but there\u2019s also toasted coconut, toffee, vanilla and molasses. It\u2019s super sweet, but smoothly integrated as well, and I pick up zero alcohol. The velvety medium body is just so smooth, with super-light carbonation. Some alcohol comes through the nose and is noticeable in throat and mouth as well, but it\u2019s not too off-putting.This one really reminds of Firestone 14, with its dark cherry sweetness, and the fact that this is the result of aging in a single barrel and not a blended bunch is even more impressive.

Malt appears only to prop up the hops, it's not very sweet but it bready and doughy, kind of like angel food cake batter before the sugar is added. Although the nose doesn't give away the malt character, the flavor surely does. It's sweet, like caramel-flavored taffy, but never tastes saccharine or overdone. The hops burst through the malt anyway, offering tart citrus peel, mint and spruce. Super-clean, breezy, bright, vibrant. Expertly well-balanced, with alcohol hardly pushing through and only delivering a kind of gentle spiciness. Long bitter/spicy finish features spearmint and more citrus rind, with a flash of candy-like sweetness. Fantastic.Feels like a beer of this type should...carbonated just enough, but yielding to a rounded medium body.

        "text": "I've had the 120 Minute IPA several times now, and have been looking forward to reviewing it. This one is poured from a bottle with a &quot;bottled on&quot; date of 5/10/07 into a belgian style snifter. A 12oz bottle costs me $10 in the DC area.Appears a very golden copper color with a sticky, off-white and slightly orange head. Held up to the natural light from the window the true beauty of this beer shines through; hues of ruby red and deep orange bronze shine brightly. The nose is, as could be expected with a beer of such high alcohol, boozy. But it's still attractive, because the layers of complexity filter down from there. Strong malts, powerful hops, aged dark fruit, citrus on steroids. The taste is bold and, if you're unprepared, can hit you like a mack truck. Strong alcohol presence eventually gives way to dark fruits, rich molasses, and hoppy resin. To me, it's almost like dining on an overwhelming serving of a piney butter pecan ice cream. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel. At times it's almost syrupy. This is an intense beer and should not be taken likely; 21% ABV is hardcore for any brew. This is best served as an after-dinner drink, in my opinion, like a fine sherry or brandy. To be enjoyed in the smoking room with a cigar over a discussion of Rudyard Kipling or Ernest Hemingway. Something absurd like that. But damn it's tasty. This one has been on the shelf for a few months, and I'm sure this sucker ages quite nicely, seeing as its alcohol level could sustain it for years. But I actually prefer the 120 Minute as fresh as possible. I think the piney/citrus notes in the hops stand out more when the beer is fresh. But I highly recommend it either way to fans and self-declared afficiandos of IPAs everywhere. But be warned... this is a BIG beer.",

Normally, I avoid fruit-containing beers as, said fruit tends to dominate the character of the beer and, frankly, if I wanted fruit I'd have bought a peach.However, the investment in the six pack (and it IS and investment!) warranted a tasting and I was flabbergasted by the result. Simply put, this beer is exceptional.Color is as described (by Dogfish Head), ie, mahogany. It's also got a good dose of protein in the head and the lacing hangs around for the duration. Beer is crystal clear.Aroma is mysterious but very rich. I think the last reviewer got it right when he said that if he hadn't known that there were raisins in the beer, he wouldn't have know what was going on here. As it is, the beer smells inviting, al beit a bit intimidating. After all, who's well-versed in the quaffing of dried fruit?!?The flavor is great. Complex, like a (barley) wine though w/o the alcohol punch. Very deep. Finish is clean. There's a noticeable sticky sweetness on the lips, but nothing cloying on the palate. Other than that, you are simply left with the memories of the fruit, and a nagginig invitation to take another sip.Overall, a singular and outstanding beer!-ExMPS, Brothers, what the hell were you drinking?

The head is almost nonexistent, even on initial pour. The high alcohol content is hinted at by the impressive &quot;legs&quot; and thick, creamy lacing around the glass.S - The aroma is strongly centered on hops, which are piney, spicy and peppery. They seem to be a US variety, but I'm not sure which one. There is also some malt and sweet alcohol in the background. From the smell I am reminded of some of Dogfish Head's higher alcohol offerings.T - The flavor is also dominated by the hops. Again it is piney and spicy and gives an impression of freshness, like a hop harvest beer. Toward the end of the palate the hops develop into a slightly harsh, soap-like note. The malt is fairly subdued, but alcohol is assertive and provides some complexity beyond the hops. There are also some Belgian yeast notes. M - Heavy body. Lots of hop bitterness and alcohol that give an almost chili-pepper-like burn in the mouth. There is a mouth-coating sweetness.O - This beer is unusual in its US hops assertiveness, but it retains some of the elements of a strong Belgian ale.

It recedes at a medium pace, leaving little bits of particulate lace, and a nice film of hefty bubbles across the top of the beer. There is a definite haze to the beer, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation look slowed by the syrupy thickness of the beer. As we sniff, bitter leaf and pine hops hit the nose hard. There is a sickly sweet orange citrus twang floating among them, and earthiness pops through. Malts act to balance the aromas nicely, imparting a bit more sweetness to the bitterness that is the hops. Yeast and a pinch of booze are just palpable over each hop wave. The taste begins with grassy hops that seem, briefly, somewhat floral. Cleanliness and sweetness of malt immediately balance what would otherwise be extreme hop bitterness. The middle shows more bitterness, but it rides tight against the top of the palate. The rest of the mouth is filled with malts and some simultaneously biting and sweet citric character. As the taste rounds out for the finish, earthiness bubbles up. This is, again, from the hops, but also from a faint mineral flavoring prickling the tongue. The aftertaste breathes with sweet and bitter hoppy nectar, with hints of more grassy hops and some booze thrown into the mix. The body is medium and the carbonation is medium. Each sip imparts a thickness to the lips, with a generous coating down the throat with every pass. The mouth, in the end, is left astringently dry, and suckling. The brew is creamy to sip, and nicely palpable. The abv is within range and the beer drinks with ease.Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was its unabashed hoppiness. Many IPAs and even DIPAs will go lighter on the hop flavoring, while delivering much of it to the nose. Here there is a wonderful amalgamation of taste and aroma, where the flavors and smells seem to match up expertly, making this a contender for the style.",

An extreme West Coast hop profile with loads and loads of what smells like Amarillo. Smells like sweet, resinous, pine with tangerine, grapefruit, and passionfruit. Maybe a touch of lemon grass and some light caramel round it out. Taste (4): Hugely fruity up front with the citrus notes from the nose dominating: mango, passionfruit, and lemon. The bitterness doesn't show up until the finish along with an overwhelming sweetness. The same citrus notes stay through the middle but are then dominated by the sweetness and a lingering pine. Some mango shows up here too, but is not huge like the front end.

Medium to full body with a fizzy carbonation on the roof of the mouth. A truly unique and pretty good stronger ale, a lot to like here. Also a lot of love-it-or-hate-it spicing. Personally, I tend towards liking this ale which feels most like a Belgian saison but with notable Asian influence.",

It is mostly clear with a short-lived pink head that leaves no lacing as it fades. Not much in the way of visible carbonation.S-The aroma has a nice berry flavor that doesn't overpower the musty, earthy, subtle base beer. I also sniff some lightly funky brett and grain. Sour level is pretty light.T-The taste tracks the smell closely. The berry flavors are clean and distinct if not terribly complex or powerful. There is a low to medium level of acidity and a sourness that balances nicely with the lightly funky brett flavors. M-The carbonation is medium in volume and the body is moderate with a slightly slick feeling.O-Like the Petite Sour Raspberry that I drank alongside this one, Petite Sour Boysenberry is a nice, easy-to-drink fruited sour beer.

Beneath the captivating tropical fruit addition is the usual cocktail of aggressive West Coast hops profile that put Sculpin on the map: grapefruit, orange, peach, and a hint of resiny pine.Unsurprisingly, pineapple is the biggest impression on the palate. The pineapple megaton punch doesn't leave behind a lasting impression, however, as it gently recedes and lets the spicy Sculpin bite take over. Lots of resiny pine, some floral notes, and grapefruit-peel are the characteristics I'm picking up.The pineapple returns to accentuate the malty sweetness with a bit of tropical flavor in the back. When Ballast Point first announced this brew I thought it was just another gimmick to sell more expensive beer, but the pineapple definitely adds dimensions of depth that I didn't see coming.Medium-light bodied, with a mouthfeel and carbonation that reminds me a lot of Grapefruit Sculpin. The absence of the commanding and sticky mouthfeel of the regular Sculpin actually works to the beer's favor, making it delightfully refreshing despite the high ABV.",

The cloudiness shows that this beer is probably loaded with spices. The nose reveales all of the spicing mentioned on the bottle (Pumpkin, cinnamon stick, nutmeg, and clove). Also on the nose is a subtle bready malt character that works quite well with the spicing. If there are any hops in the nose, they are overwhelmed by the spicing.The taste is very similar to the nose. Everything is quite well mixed, unlike other Pumpkin Ales I have had that are way overspiced. This beer is very subtle but full flavored. There ARE hops in this beer, but quite mellow in the finish. Could easily be confused with the bite of other spices and/or alcohol.The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of a grittiness it seems.

Very similar in appearance to Cognac Church on a Hill.S- Apples, a bit of brandy (not overpowering), some oak, raisins, figs, and underlying dark fruits, sweet malts. I actually liked this aroma better then King Henry, I felt like it was slightly less boozey.T- Apple Brandy notes with underlying well-balanced flavors of toffee, dark fruits, oak, figs, raisins, finishes with more apple brandy. Fairly sweet, a little bit sugary, and very well balanced. The barrel adds a nice integration to the beer giving it a nice apple brandy flavor without dominating the beer too much or making it seem overly boozey. M- Smooth (although not as smooth as KH), low carbonation but decent for style, very easy drinking, booze hidden amazingly well.O- I wouldn't say this quite stacks up to KH, but overall in my opinion it's probably the second best barleywine I've had. It's not quite as smooth or complex as KH and KH beats it in almost every category except aroma. I felt like Leon hid the booze a little bit better in the nose.

Smells like a typical American IPA with some more herbal characteristics from the rye.T - Initially the sweet malt and American hops go together. Followed by some of the more herbal and grainy tones. In the middle the rye hits with some slight spice and a nice flavor that isn't typical for an IPA. The finish has more of a resinous hop character with some mild bitterness both from the hops and the rye. The ale yeast also provides a slight fruitiness and helps the hops give this full flavored beer a more well rounded profile.M - Medium mouth-feel. Moderate carbonation.

There aren't too many RyPAs on the market and this one takes a typical American IPA and puts a little spin on it giving it just enough nuance to keep it interesting. This isn't going to be my new go to IPA but if you haven't tried a rye IPA or are a fan of the style this is a good one to get since it is more mild and conventional than some of the style I've had before.

First off, it is a collaboration between Shorts and a few other Northern Michigan breweries. They all used the same maltbill, as he put it, but used their own water and yeast. I say this because I had the same beer at Right Brain and it is amazing the difference between the two beers. My first question to Jon was what classification they gave this beer and he said they were calling it a Strong Ale, not a Stout. I asked because when I had the Right Brain version, I swear they called it a Brown Ale and that the a.b.v. was a bit lower. A: Pitch black with a 1.5 finger dark mocha head poured into a 14 oz. goblet. The head retention was good, especially the ring around the edge of the glass. The lacing of the beer was sporadic and not very sticky. S: There was a pretty even blend of roasted dark malts, dark chocolate and some sweet and tart fruit flavors. I think my nose was a little congested, because the aroma was not huge, but it did smell quite good.T: The first thing that confronted my palate was a big, roasty malt flavor. A dark chocolate flavor was also present, as well as a little bit of an acidic bite. As the beer warmed, a dried cherry and plum aspect started to jump on my tongue. There was also a molasses creaminess to the flavor. M: Big and rich. Saddle up my horse and ride into the city. Yeeha. Extremely creamy, with a nice, puckering finish from the fruity tartness. D: This one took me awhile to tackle, but not because it wasn't drinkable. It was quite complex in flavor and I enjoyed trying to decipher its secrets.",

Pours a thick, viscous black oil-like substance that blocks all light. Has a small dark brown head, which slowly dissipates, leaving faint lacing. This is a brutal-looking beer. Burying my nose in my Samuel Smith pint glass, the aroma of this beer is so overpowering that my nostrils sting a bit.

As I swallow this brew, it sticks to my tongue and throat like tar, and oh God is it pleasant. The taste... like no other Imperial I've yet tried. The beautiful sugars are there, the chocolate, some smokiness and most definitely alcohol, though it's remarkably well-handled. The alcohol doesn't burn or overpower the rest of the taste, but it warms the throat and stomach all the way down. What I find most appealing about the taste is that, while sweet, it's not at all cloying. It's like drinking a chocolate liqueur, but a hundred times better. Again, no coffee to speak of.EDIT: as I continue to drink this beer, more and more tastes emerge. Lots of dark fruits, almost a rum characteristic. I LOVE the way it changes as it warms. If anyone can drink more than one of these in a sitting I want to shake your hand.The text on the bottle is awesome, too: &quot;Mephistopheles is the crafty shapeshifter, the second fallen angel; he who does not love light. Herein he patiently lies, waiting and willing to do your bidding, but for a price. Enter into his darkness, a tangled and intricate labyrinth of bittersweet rapture.&quot;Highly recommended.",

The color is a very hazed amber with golden hue and white head with fine bead lace clings to the glass with decent retention.  The smell has a tropical scent with dank herbal element of simcoe and perhaps a slight grapefruit accent yet there is a hint of malt in the smell. The feel is good with lots of hop resins and medium high carbonation balance is toward dry yet bitterness is restrained with slight alcohol inn the feel. The taste is very good with a lot of hop flavor with plenty of citrus and tropical fruit -mango and pineapple with slight pine/herbal flavor and some malt in the middle to keep it from becoming to bitter/astringent. The flavor of alcohol is noticeable as it warms but it is a 9% IPA so not that unreasonable. This was a very enjoyable IPA it has a lot of hop flavor which is fresh -not for those that don't enjoy high alpha American hops very tasty I recommend it for fans of the Imperial IPA Style",

This ale seemed to lean more towards a Belgian style than saison or farmhouse, almost like a mild fruit enhanced tripel. The yeast and spicing were more traditional than funky. The malt, yeast and spicing were well balanced with the peach flavors, making this a pleasant drinking, integrated ale. The peach flavors were quite fresh tasting and subdued enough to blend with the malt body. Slightly sweet and with a light tartness made the peach flavors like a ripe peach with its tart skin.

The crystal clear, golden colored liquid was capped by a rocky, two-finger tall, off white crown. Fantastic retention. Large patches of splotchy, craggily lacing stuck along the glass.The nose was crisp and bright with an intensely dry and powdery yeastiness. Quite tart. Citrus zest was noticeable. Wheaty. Slightly funky and musty. Subtle spice notes were detectible. Clove and coriander were most apparent. There was a hint of sweetness as well. This reminded me a bit of lemon candies or maybe even SweetTarts.The flavor profile was even more tart and complex than the nose. Super crisp and dry with loads of lemon and orange peel. Quite brett-y/bug-y. Moderately funky. Straw-like. Even though the beer was aged in rye barrels, I thought it exhibited notes of white wine. Slightly sweet with a touch of spiciness. Coriander was detectible. Floral hops were noticeable on the back end and in the dry, oaky finish. Pithy lemon rind notes also came through. Again, SweetTarts came to mind. Immensely refreshing and, with the 6.9% ABV nowhere to be found, far too drinkable.The mouthfeel was also spectacular. Super frothy and fluffy on the palate. The liquid contained a lively, somewhat aggressive effervescence that gave the beer a pillowy soft texture. Spot-on for the style.After reading the initial reviews of this beer and listening to people complain that it did not contain much &quot;wild ale&quot; character, I decided to cellar my bottle for a year. The result was a beer with the tart, brett-centric complexities of a wild ale and the crisp, spicy components of a saison.

This thing had staying power like I have never seen before. Three inches of head that sat on top all night and as it dropped left tons of spider web like lacing all up and down the sides of the glass, simply remarkable.The aroma was unlike anything I had come across. Deep chocolate malts, touches of roasted notes, and a deep hop presence combined to form a wall of smell that was knocking me out. Warming brought out tons of sweet, melodic notes of warm alcohol and molasses only to be cut by piney hops and brought to a whole different level. Each sip was like dessert for me. Decadent flavor coated the tongue from the rich, smooth feel. Chocolate, vanilla, coffee notes collide and mesh with the huge drying hops in the back of the profile. Really just insanely well done.

It holds very well, eventually dropping to a thin, cottony, half-surface covering, but it continually leaves rings and splotches of lace about the pint.The nose expresses dark malt acidity and yeasty fruitiness, bittersweet - or even baker's - chocolate, black coffee, and a waft of more charred roastiness; yet it's not bold or brash. In a way it's sublime, or, at least as sublime as a beer of this depth can be. The flavor follows suite, and although it's chock full of dark chocolate, black coffee, an edge of caramel, a rich center of lightly tart berry-like fruit and some more ashen roastiness, it's not brash or biting. The bitterness is kept to a minimum, and it's soft and supple, allowing it's softer, underlying flavors to come through (some butterscotch, leather, straw, herbs). And that, despite a curious amount of yeast left at the bottom of the bottle and the bottom of the glass... not overly acidic or yeast at all. Very well rounded and soft. Across the palate it's velvety smooth with a slick, oily mouthfeel and medium body and very-fine, restrained, natural carbonation from bottle-conditioning.Quite possibly the best beer from Dark Horse.

The nose is ripe and citrusy, with more lemon than oranges, and notes of white grape, but this is definitely not syrupy sweet as it has a certain mouthwatering tartness in the nose that I've rarely experienced. The taste is equally bright and citrusy with heavy handed hay and grains, a honey-like sweetness, zesty citrus, and yeast in the finish. The mouthfeel is light bodied and well attenuated, effervescent, promoting grain and citrus in the middle, but has a semi-dry, lingering yeastiness that makes for a pleasant aftertaste. This beer is seriously classy as hell and absolutely meets my expectations for the style.",

Head's there but tends to be a thin sheen when you don't aggressively pour it.It's hoppy...obviously. The main thing is the sheer amount of scents and flavors coming from those hops. Pineapple, pear, mango, citrus, pine, maraschino cherries, rum, and a surprising amount of malt. This is a flavor assault, but it's not really boozy at all. In fact, that 9.5% can catch up to you before you know it. Bitterness is there, but the malt's there to keep everything in order.Goes down deceptively easy and I could see splitting several of these bombers with friends.Definitely one of the best DIPA's around.

Visible carbonation is minimal, but the color is a lovely dark, translucent amber with a hint of red.Smell:There's a lot to describe here. I basically smell citrus and spice, but let me try to embellish a bit more. To me, it smells almost like orange and cinnamon and maybe a hint of pine, but others may feel differently. Maltiness is dominant relative to hoppiness, but it's balanced pretty well for my nose.Taste:It matches the nose well, but not quite in terms of balance. On the palate, the orange flavor seems to outweigh the spice characteristics; there's a very nice &quot;bite&quot; at the end. I'd still say that it's a bit more malty than hoppy, but it's balanced pretty well - the spiciness expands in the aftertaste portion of tasting.Mouthfeel:It's a bit on the thicker side for an ale, but much to my liking. I suppose the visible creaminess in the head is best manifest in this portion of the review.Drinkability:Goes down smooth - what else can I say? Like I say in many of my other reviews, I'd avoid pounding this beer in lieu of it's excellent flavor. Again, it's also on the thicker side.Summary:I've been told that this is Magic Hat's &quot;christmas ale,&quot; even though the label indicates otherwise. Either way, it's simply excellent. The characteristics are a bit strange for what I would expect from a seasonal brew of this style (more along the &quot;nutty&quot; or &quot;earthy&quot; line), but it's too well balanced to chide it for that.

I gave the beer a sip considering my past with their beers, but I was greeted by one of the best sweet stouts I've ever had in my life. There is a PERFECT amount of coffee and java sweetness that does not overpower the beer in any way whatsoever. Plus, the creaminess of the the mouth feel is absolutely incredible and compliments the beer amazingly.This beer is an absolute treat. To compare it to something more well known it would be Three Floyds Moloko, but every aspect of it being upped a notch.

This is my first La Folie and since it's 2.5 yrs old I can't say how it compares to a fresh one but at this point it's a nice smooth drink.

More of this in the taste, with smooth coffee taking the foreground, semi-sweet chocolate, bourbon, with a minor hint of barrel wood, vanilla, brown sugar, dark malty goodness. Good balance of roasty and sweet. Smooth and full-bodied, definitely some alcohol warmth in there, but it's well-integrated.

        "text": "Poured from growler (filled on 3/7) into my Tired Hands pint glass.Shep's Memory has a beautiful amber body with great clarity, though not perfect, showing off some lazy carbonation. It's topped by a thick peach-colored sudsy foam that slowly falls, coating everything in sheets of lacing. This beer could not look any better for the style.The aroma is exactly what one would hope for in a Bitter: tea-like hops mixing beautifully with serious bready malts in the background, with just a light hint of honey sweetness. There isn't anything I would change, not do I think this could be improved.The palate of this is also closely aligned with the style parameters. The body is light, the carbonation is soft and minimal, and the texture is very fluid and round. The flavors are very gentle here, and express themselves more in the mid-palate to aftertaste than they do up front. A light flavor of hops up front (again, somewhat tea-like...black tea) that is followed by a toasted bread note towards the finish, and a lingering, gentle bitterness that is somewhat astringent. The hops are more present than they would be in an English version.I can't say enough about Shep's Memory...this was a total surprise to see such a well-executed beer come out of a brewery known for hoppy APA/IPA/DIPA's and funky Saisons. However, they nailed this Bitter-style (as well as another surprising beer that they made called Trendler, an Altbier) and showed that they are no 2-trick pony! Slightly Americanized, but immediately recognizable as an English Bitter. I enjoyed this beer so much that I got my growler re-filled with this one...a rare occasion. If they make this beer again, I would try this with their Grilled Cheese in a heartbeat!",

For the price, which I indubitably hesitated on and then bought anyway, its just not worth the money when so many are out there. I have had every month except one and I guess that throws the whole thing off anyway for symmetry.  Color: Golden fall like color, decent head retention which relaxes to a decent lacing pattern.Aroma: Pretty much like most of them, it has a nice fruity hop character. Grapefruit, peach, some other citrus character. Not as piney as one would think, I bet next month will be!Taste: They are all pretty smooth, they are all pretty pedestrian. I love Foothills, but my all time favorite, which I wish they would just start putting out all the time, is Jade. I wish they would just start putting them in six packs. But, then it wouldn't be as special.Overall: Same story, good beer, cool idea, too pricey for what you get! If this beer was $4 or 5 then no question it would be totally worth every cent. But, when you can get a Lagunitas or Stone Bomber for less than this, there issues. I know smaller brewery, small footprint, its all about the business and quantity of what they can obtain and distribute, but it is what it is. Undoubtedly I will buy next months to finish out the year.",

Really nice blend of bitter citrus and cocoa that intermingle and blend quite nicely. Bits of dark cherry and plum fade in and out of the cocoa and coffee. Semi-thick and creamy. Nicely charred malt.

The alcohol tickles the nose as well but is not strong enough to overtake the power of the ingredients. Taste: Coffee is the strongest during the initial taste. The cocoa flavor sits on the palate as an aftertaste. The lingering aftertaste is of charred oak or tobacco. Exhaling through the nose with beer on the palate highlights the cocoa nibs and toastiness of the coffee. Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, but venturing on a tad too much. The beer beneath the carbonation is slippery, verging on oily, yet I would classify it as more of a glossy consistency.Overall: The complexity of this beer is wonderful.

The head slowly drops to a full lace leaving webs of sticky rings down the side of the glass.S- At first sniff, it had a very champagne-like, earthy/musty/yeasty aroma (all meant in the most pleasant of terms). On further inspection, I picked up sweet, berry-like tones (raspberry with a touch of blueberry perhaps?).T- More of the yeasty notes from the aroma are present in the flavor. There were some light, earthy hops and berry flavors in the background. There was also a touch of peppery, spiciness that I assume was provided by the yeast. It had a very clean, dry finish (much as a dryish champagne) that gave some characteristics of green apple.M- It had a soft feel with a delicate, yet fully carbonated body. There was a slight warming sensation from the alcohol and a totally, bone-dry finish.D- It's such an intriguing beer. I'm not necessarily going to have a ton in a single sitting, and cost makes it more of a celebratory beer. That said, I want more!!!Overall- This is a great combination of traditional traits, as well as, an innovative take on ingredients. I was a little weary going into this beer.

Tastes not as strong as I had expected but nonetheless fucking excellent. Like, wow. Deep caramel hangs over a start of buttertoffee and ripe fruit, moving into herbs and citrus hops, then finishing on vanilla and bourbon and Rogue's delicious wonderbready yeast. That's the kicker, right there: the yeast. I nearly thought this was a letdown, for the first few sips, and had I written this review at the beginning of the bottle I probably would have given the taste a 4.5. Thing was, it seemed a little light to cost as much as it did. But I can't hold that against this, as it's not supposed to be a big beer. It's supposed to be balanced, smooth, drinkable, and wonderfully variegated, and it's all of those with spades.",

The Brett presents itself as mostly hay and lemon.I'm really surprised at how good this one turned out. All of the elements- wheat ale, DIPA, and brett show themselves nicely and meld well together. The wheat provides some nice bitterness, while the DIPA provides some really insanely juicy hop flavors, and the Brett shows itself on the back end, providing some chalky bitterness along with a slight tart twang, and the smallest amount of barnyard funk. They really kept the Brett in check here. The Brett seems to have amplified the fruitiness of the hops, which is really nice and really appreciated by my mouth. The Brett character is magnificently restrained here, it stays in the back and supports everything else.This is medium bodied, pretty full for an IPA, with a crisp and refreshing mouthfeel.

While still a good drink, the simcoe hops seem to have faded, as they give off more of a grapefruit citrus taste. There is nice lacing along the glass, indicating an incredibly sticky beer. The body is a rusted copper brown, with a slight haze to it. The smell is predominately grapefruit and caramel sweetness. Again, going off of memory, I distinctly recall a fatal punch of Simcoe hops the first time I had this beer which resulted in a very piney winterfresh scent. The taste is mostly grapefruit citrus, with a fair pine hop kick towards the end. In the background, caramel malts provide both balance and substance. The mouthfeel is a bit wet, again not something true to this beer when served fresh. Could easily drink this beer again, but I would have preferred it to be fresh as I remember it best.",

Drank from my Darkness snifter while watching game 6 of the 2011 World Series (St. Louis vs. Texas).Appearance- Pours a deep dark black with a huge one finger cinnamon brown head that is fluffy and rich. The cap eventually disappears all together leaving a thin collar with nto much lacing.Smell- Everything you\u2019d expect from a nice Imperial Stout. Very roasted smelling that borders on espresso with a subdued sort of intensity. A bit of chocolate and/or fudge makes its appearance as it very much smells like Tootsie Rolls. Maybe a touch of caramel but it\u2019s fairly light but a definite raw grainy thing is lingering. I don\u2019t get much in the way of hops except maybe just a hint of some grassiness. The alcohol is pretty potent as well.Taste- Starts with tons of raw chewy brownie batter that is dark and rich and very intense. Not overly sweet which I love but there is a nice touch of caramel mixed in with all that chocolate. I don\u2019t get much in the way of super deep dark roast or coffee. Maybe a touch of vanilla mixes in for an almost cream like flavor and just a hint of licorice. Sort of a deceiving bitterness too with a few citrus tones every now and again. A touch of alcohol in the end but not near what I thought it would be from the nose.Mouthfeel- Thick rich and smooth as silk. Nice light carbonation with a touch of warming.Drinkability- Very surprised by this beer! It\u2019s super chocolaty and nicely balanced. This went down really easy, almost too easy.

The slightly off-white head is quick to recede, leaving a thin ring with little to no action on the surface. The color and clarity are oustanding, but a lack of retention or lacing is concerning.S- Deep and sweet cherry aroma with a slight acidity that isn't derived from the fruit. As it warms, a mellow vinegar aroma adds complexity along with an oaky vanilla character.T- A tingle of carbonic acid and a pucker of acidity hit the front of the palate immediately. Followed quickly by tart cherries and a funky, sour brown, vinegar. Finishes fruit dominant; no malt or hop influence. Part sour brown-part New Glarus fruit beer: a balanced combination that extracts the best of both styles.M- High carbonation with a light, dry body. The cherries give the perception of a little bigger body, clinging relentlessly to the palate, but without leaving any cloying sweetness. D- A little less cherry would give this very high drinkability, but might disturb that nice balance of styles that this beer has going for it.

I have to say, the beer is aptly named. With the nitro pour, it is the smoothest mouthfeel I've ever had on a beer. Dark, mostly opague, as expected from an Imperial Stout. What was surprising was the balance and not-overwhelming dark malts. I really enjoyed the intial taste/mouthfeel, which is sometimes a bit over-the-top with this style. The complexity of the malt came later, and with almost no bitter aftertaste like I was expecting.

Backing pale malt notes of cracker, grains, caramel, and yeast. A very good hop forward IPA like taste. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Crisp, juicy, and somewhat oily with a drying finish. Overall: A very good hop forward Pale Ale. Big citrus and pine flavor. Very much like a West Coast style IPA. A pretty cool collaboration.",

The taste - once again, wow, ok, there is a decent sour to tart start to the flavoring but once it starts to warm a bit, it balances out and begins to let the fruits and Belgian spices overtake it a bit.

Orange hues tamper down the glow in the glass while bubbles creep up the sides in streams. The head is mellow and linen white, while falling to a thin cap it manages to leave silky sheet lacing down every surface it touched. Looks delicious!The nose is slam packed with dense orange oils, bordering on dankness. Clean alcohol adds some spiciness while tickling the nose. The barrel aging is subtle with a hint of vanilla and a helping of sandalwood that really adds to the overall depth.With warming comes a smattering of tropical notes in the background. Unique and savory.As dense and potent as the nose seems to be the flavor is more subtle and well balanced. The orange oils are rich from start to finish, growing in intensity on their way through. A touch of vanilla pops up in the middle and sandalwood always seems to be on the periphery. Caramel is a sturdy malt backbone. Alcohol, again, adds a bit of spice. The orange oils bitter up nicely on the swallow.The body has heft, leaning toward the full side of the spectrum. Hop bitterness is large and in charge while tannic dryness seems to accentuate it even more. Tannins and alcohol both seem to dry up the body, the alcohol leaving some soft fumes in it's wake. The bitterness lingers. Drinkability is good for such a big beer.Barrel aged IPAs have always seemed a weird creation to me but oddly enough I've had some really great ones in the past. Coming in Hops is another good example. The dense orange oils play well with sandalwood. The bitterness is big and yet the drinkability, for such a huge beer, is up there. Thanks again, Wil!.",

Loved the old-school look and the heaviness of the bottle, as well as the &quot;best before&quot; date on the bottom of the back. This seemed like one of the classics and after finally giving this a go, I can say that this was something I should have had a long time ago. Nothing about it blew me away but but when it comes to quintessential English beers, there isn't a better example than this!Good pour to this, with a fairly deep apricot hue, present but not overpowering head, and just a bit of lacing that slowly slid down the sides of my pint glass. Not a terribly strong aroma to accompany this but there was some tea and a hint of earthy hops. More of that could be picked up in the taste, along with some earl grey, floral notes, mild sweetness, and a slight metallic twinge in the aftertaste. Just the right amount of carbonation to go with a slick and almost buttery mouthfeel. I was amazed how easily this went down for a beer that never felt or tasted weak and this reminded me of the ESB when it came to the balance the consistency of it. Even though I only bought one bottle of this, I could have downed a few in a sitting. This had &quot;session&quot; written all over it (not literally) and thankfully, all of the ingredients were British. I say that because it's hard for me to picture something not along the lines of Boddington's or Bass but had a nice niche all of it's own. While not like their American counterparts, this fell into a style that I could easily enjoy and even love. Beers like this are a classic for reason - no one would ever want to see this change. A must-try for anyone looking to find a new session Ale that feels like an old friend.",

        "text": "2011 750 ml bottle at Euclid Hall in Denver, poured 6-29-14. Pours dark brownish amber, slightly murky, with a small off white to khaki head. The head recedes quickly and there is just a rim around the edges by the time I take a sip. Aroma is big bourbon notes, heavy caramel malts, light molasses, vanilla, oak, and more bourbon. Flavor follows the aroma rather closely with a nice caramel molasses feel, supported by bourbon in the background. Light vanilla notes are there, but not as strong as when fresh I would guess. Body is thinner than expected--especially after loving regular hibernation so much--but maybe a slight nitpick. Still some decent carbonation in this one. Definitely a beer to seek out if you can find it. Not sure it was worth the $54 price tag at the restaurant, but hey, you only live once.Taking a stab with a 2014 bottle. Seems that people have been worried about infection with this one but I don't see any sign here. I can see where someone might mistake the flavors for sour, but they're largely from the whiskey and remind me much of the 2011 with an interesting herbal bitterness that nicely balances out the sweeter notes that you normally get from a BA old ale. I think this is nicely done overall, and a a nice winter warmer despite the unseasonably warm weather this Winter 2015.",

The head is creamy smooth but settles with a couple of minutes.The aroma is sweet and wheaty (I just made a new word) and has a great light lemon citrus that brings a nice freshness.Flavor is very good as well. I've probably had more German than American wheat beers over the past year so this comes a little as a surprise: no cloves, no bananas, and no German yeast esters, obviously. What it does have is a very clean, fresh, smooth what base with just a hint of citrus. Not as complex as the Germans but just as tasty in its own right.Mouthfeel is medium-plus bodied with a creamy smooth texture that likely comes from the unfiltered sediment and lower carbonation.Overall a fantastic, easy-drinking, lighter summer ale.

However, it's noticeably mellower than the Torpedo IPA (is it the color?) without losing the signature IPA flavors.

So black that there are some purplish red highlights around the edges. Very little head on the pour, just a little froth. Smell is black licorice, malts and just a hint of alcohol. Taste is very traditional baltic porter. Black patent malts, more of a black licorice flavor and just a hint of cocoa/coffee. This beer is very creamy and smooth. I drank this much faster than I even noticed. Within minutes my glass was empty and I didn't even notice until it was too late. Way to drinkable, and just way too damn good.",

Aroma hit me while pouring, a lot of hops, particularly early in the glass, and even more so when I had this a month ago when it was really fresh. Earthy, piney, hops, with a whole lot of sweet caramel and roasted malt on the nose. Flavor is even better than the aroma, a burst of earthy hops then a big dose of sweet caramel, chocolate, and roasted malts, with a good bitter yet also sweet lingering finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and rich but also slick, goes down really nice. Medium to high carbonation. I like to think of this as a dark IPA, especially when it's super fresh. I'm on my second 6-pack for this review, Yakima Twilight is fantastic. I'll save one to cellar to see what this is like more malt-forward, but I don't think it will equal what I'm drinking right now.",

The head formed 1-2 fingers thick and faded to one finger, retaining nicely from there. Aroma: Raisins, plums, spices, very sweet and complex. Once you get ner the bottom you smell the yeast a lot more.Taste: Some sweet malt it first, then it gets very complex. Ripe fruit, spices, and some yeast all combine nicely. The finish is sweet and spicy, with a slight alcohol warming in the end.Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, very crisp. The carbonation is lively and compliments the flavors nicely. Overall: An excellent Belgian style ale. I let this one sit for two years in my makeshift cellar, upright rather than on its side, and the main difference I notice is that the yeast character present in the unibroue offerings is muted somewhat.

It smells like a pile of decomposing grass clippings. Choking one down may be impossible, and after that you will not want another. I know this beer well, unfortunately, because as one other reviewer noted it is ubiquitous at Chicago street fests and bars. The smell coming off of dozens of pre-poured cups of this crap, and the pools of foamy 312 slop on the ground at outdoor beer tents is really nauseating. My neighbor presented me with a 12 pack for watching his cat, and it has been sitting by my front door for four months, which is somewhat vexing. But, I can't bring myself to just throw it out, because after all, it is technically beer. If anyone wants it, come by and you can have it for free.

I do have fond memories of my friend and I stealing our respective father's supply of this and drinking them in the backyard when we were younger, but as a beer itself? How does it compare?A- It has that extremely fake appearance sported by most Aussie macros. This is cheap and factory assembled. An aggressive pour gets a miniscule head, which vanishes but for a blotch on top. The carbonation loses its bite quickly as it becomes stagnant and tepid.S- Judging a book by its cover works when smelling this beer. It smells as it looks: artificial. Basically, some kind of awful, out of place sweetness assaults my sense of smell. The worst part is, I really can't tell what is causing this scent. Is it malt? God no. Is it hops? I sincerely doubt that. Whatever it is, smells like it should definitely not be there.T- To this beer's credit, it is very consistent from nose to palate. That is most certainly not a desirable thing, though. This tastes quite rank. That saccharin-esque sweetness is horribly discernable throughout and leaves a sickly feeling on your tongue. Also, it finishes with the dreaded and most feared of all things- POR. I prefer the taste of XXXX to this and believe me, that is saying something.M- It's bloating, gassy, abrasive and watery.

These guys are slowly becoming one of my favorite stout/porter brewers in the USA. From a 500ml bottle into a snifterAPPEARANCE: This one slowly started to foam out after opening. A brown pour yields a huge, four finger, medium looking, light tan head with good retention. Transparent bistre brown in color, almost black, and no carbonation evident. Head is massive, but eventually fades to a rocky, foamy, bubbly thick cap and leaves some chunky lacing down the sides. A half bubbly wisp remains and leaves lots of bubbly lacing down the glass. The foaming and massive head make this one look infected. SMELL: Definitely smells infected as well. First wiff is tart cherries and vinegar. Yikes. After a few more wiffs, there is a touch of bourbon and oak in there, as well as a light hint of cocoa powder. Still, this smells tart, which is never a good thing for this style. TASTE: Sour and tart as well. Some roasted malts and a touch of cocoa in there, as well as oak, vanilla and bourbon from the barrel aging, but there is definitely a sour and acidic flavor that dominates it all. Tart cherries and vinegar accompany a touch of bourbon, oak anf light bitter coffee in the bold and lingering aftertaste. This is 100% infected. Unfortunate. PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, goes down fine and finishes slightly dry. Some acidity definitely lingers. OVERALL: Can't imagine this was the point. While it calmed a little as it sat, this bottle is clearly infected, which is very disappointing to say the least. HF has been nothing but phenomenal so far, what with BoT, Damon, and Daybreak being spectacular, so ignoring this little blip will be easy. Be wary of searching this one out. Drain pour.

Atop the beer is a dirty white head that is of poor quality and proves it by deflating rapidly and leaving the glass virtually spotless.The nose is uninteresting in the extreme. It smells like sour, stale grain and... that's about it. The Leinenkugel website claims that Amber Light is brewed with both Cluster and Cascade hops. I think not. I'm not prepared to call them liars, but I defy the world's top 'scent man' from the House of Chanel to find even one ppm of Cascade hoppiness in this nose.Bad beer. It isn't bad in the 'spoiled' sense and not even in the 'off flavor, vomit inducing' sense, but in the 'weak, watery, minimally flavored' sense. I know that no one really expects light beer to be bursting with flavor, but this is taking things too far. What flavor does find its way to my taste buds has, like the nose, a stale grain quality. Cascade? Surely you jest? Hops? Surely you jest again? The mouthfeel is ultra-thin and watery with an absent finish.Needless to say, Leinie's Amber Light is lacking in all areas that matter and isn't worth your time or your money. Not even close.

        "text": "Apparently, Red Brick Winter Brew changes every year. Last year's was an oatmeal stout, this one a &quot;Belgian Style Ale.&quot; Since it pours brown, one can only assume it's a Belgian brown ale. EDIT: i have been corrected that they had the oatmeal stout as the winter brew for a few years, and have now decided to make it year-round. So this year's winter brew is replacing that. The beer pours a muddy brown with a slight greenish tinge when held to the light. (?) Head is minimal after a medium strength pour, and drops to a ring quickly. Some bubbling, and a bit of yeast sediment from the bottom of the bottle. Not a super attractive beer.Smells a bit like a weizenbock - banana, a bit of bubblegum, actually a lot of bubblegum... There's some molasses like malt in there, but also some higher, fusel alcohols evident as well as some band-aid... doesn't bode well.Flavor is also reminiscent of a weizenbock, but not a very good one. Banana bread malt with orange that turns to orange peel bitterness. It's really a mess. Phenols, diacetyl, fusels, a lingering bitterness that tastes more like bad pecans and orange peel than hops. There's some band-aid phenols and some DMS, as well as a burnt citrus... did they burn the hops? I'm having difficulty finding one positive about the way this tastes. :-(Mouthfeel is not terrible, except for the high fusels and crazy astringency in the finish that I can't seem to attach to a flavor. As I said, the bitterness is more like bad pecans than anything else, and there's little to no hop flavor, or really anything besides flaws, bubblegum, and orange peel.This is not a good beer at all. It's a shame, because I wish more semi-local breweries could produce quality product. However, if this were a homebrew of mine, I wouldn't even enter it in a competition. It's honestly one of the worst commercial beers I've had. Hopefully they'll work out their apparent sanitation/fermentation temp issues and produce a quality brew next year, as it appears they did last year. This one is a shame, and a drain pour.",

After that this thing has no characteristic of beer. It is completley undrinkable. What are brewers thinking when they make stuff like this. Can I get a Bud Light please.",

The nose is grainy and dominated by yeast and sour grapes with a weird bready malt thing going on. Tastes sweet and grainy at first, which leads to an almost sour yeasty flavour. These aren't completelt offensive, but there are qualities here I do not look for in a beer. The finish is somewhat dry and grainy. This beer suffers from yeast overload, and needs hops badly. A funny thing I have noticed is that a lot of these Quebec beers have the same overly yeasty sourness to them.",

Nobody even gave it a chance as a $21 6-pack. I digress though.The beer honestly looks pretty nice - it as a slightly darker shade of yellow than most adjunct lagers and has a copper-y colour to it that makes it resemble almost exactly the bottle of maple whiskey that is sitting on my table. Not bad on that front.The smell is also not bad. It's got the standard adjunct smell, but it has some kind of deep, fruity smell that makes smelling it almost interesting and is not offensive, especially considering the beer vatriety. Smells good; looks good; what could go wrong?Well, after the first sip, I very well knew what went wrong. The taste of this beer is just bad, bad, bad. It's a corny burst on the tongue with an explosion (no joke, it felt that way) of sour aftertaste. Going down the beer felt like straw... it was ROUGH, a term I don't even use much for heavy beers, but that is what was going on. 1's for taste and feel for sure - I can't even finish more than 5cm of the glass, it is just that putrid.

The beer is crystal clear, and no sediment is noted. Carbonation looks to rival that of the bubbliest champagne. The aroma is adjuncty and overly sweet with artificial lime and added sugars. The promised &quot;tequila&quot; notes come across closer to that of hot plastic and mineral-laden well water than liquor. As we sip, white sugar, not-so-fresh-squeezed lime juice, tin, and splashes of booze appear first. The middle exhibits an added sourness and an amplification of the metallic bite. We round out with an overwhelming sweetness to wash everything away with, and a balancing alcoholic kick. The aftertaste breathes with more lime than anything else, but again, the sweetness overcompensates, bordering on cloying. The body is light and the carbonation is high. The feel to it is otherwise watery and no coating or slurpability is noted. The mouth isn't left dry, but rather just wet. The abv is fine, even brushing a bit high, and the drinkability is slowed by the absurd sweetness.Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was its unique intent. While the aroma is questionable, to say the very least, it takes some bravery to produce a beer that is supposed to share some aromatics with something as stark as tequila. As lovers of tequila (on the side) we were not able to detect anything of the sort. The utter lacking of the advertised flavors with a beer, instead, as sweet as key lime pie, makes for little to be desired.",

Nothing noteworthy.The taste was whats to be expected from a light beer (one you can get 20 of for $10). Watery and bland. Definitely standard macrobrew and American lager. Taste got better after a couple (though I know it was for the obvious reasons).The more carbonated brew could be felt best on the tongue.

I would rather go without it. When consuming multiple however, there is an ability to have steady consumption through out the day or night.Final Thoughts - For those that bash it, there are obvious reasons. It's a cheap beer. A 20 pack in bottles can be obtained for $11 (including deposit).

Forms virtually no head, save for a ring of pale tan foam that sits atop the beer.Smell: Bourbon barrel notes are the primary aroma, heavy on the vanilla-caramel aspects, with some of the woodiness. Lurking beneath, there's a malty sweetness, with toffee-esque tinges.Taste: This drinks smooth, with almost no hint of the ABV at all. The bourbon mixes with the beer in a way that presents both chocolate and vanilla flavors at the opening, rounded off with hints of caramelly booze and oak. As it warms, there's an almost cola-like sweetness that emerges beneath the barrel notes, and some faint, very faint, shadows of dark fruit lurking far off in the distance, like shy nerdy kids peeking in the door to the prom, wondering if they should walk in or just go home and play some World of Warcraft. There's pretty much none of the esters one would expect from a weizenbock, which may be a side effect of the barrel aging process.Mouthfeel: Slick and relatively thin, verging towards watery, the feel may have influenced my perception of  the &quot;cola&quot; sweetness. There is next to no carbonation, however, just enough to keep the beer from feeling flat.Overall: For a bourbon barrel aged beer, this is not bad at all - 9% with little to no alcohol taste and heat is a plus in my book, and the flavor profile is interesting. As a weizenbock, well...this isn't one. If it was, the essence of it was lost during aging, leaving behind just a sweet, smooth, bourbony beer. Hence, I am torn on how to rate this. I would pick this up again on occasion, as I enjoyed it, but it fits the style about as well as a blower for a '57 Chevy fits a Bop-It. Since I prefer rating to stylistic elements over personal enjoyment, I am going to go that route, with the disclaimer that this is still a tasty barrel-aged beer - just not a weizenbock, per se.",

From a 37,5cl bottle into a snifterBest Before December 2022Double Imperial Honey StoutDrunk after Hornsleth, so couldn't resist the temptation to compare. APPEARANCE: Pours out black but not like Hornsleth. Black pour yields a small, bubbly, dark tan head with decent retention. Black body with no carbonation evident. Head fades to a ring and splotchy wisp. A few dots of wisp remain but leave no lacing down the glass. SMELL: Roasted and burnt malts, some dark chocolate and sweet port on the nose. Honey is there as well. More agreeable than Hornsleth, but still too burnt and charred. TASTE: Light sweetness up front with a touch of honey, then roasted, burnt and charred malts at the swallow. Char, ash and burnt grains linger on the palate with a bed of port alcohol underneath. Not as horrid as Hornsleth, but this is also too ashy, charred and boozy. PALATE: Full body, thicker and syrupy, with lower levels of carbonation. Slick and silky, goes down okay and finishes quite cloying. Some heat lingers, but no real burn at the swallow, surprisingly enough. Not as cloying as Hornsleth but still overly cloying. OVERALL: This is at least half palatable, as it seems like they actually tried to make a beer instead of a novelty. That said, it's still way too burnt, charred and ashy in flavor, while also being too cloying and sticky on the palate. Another drain pour. Not even the honey could save this one.

It looks in the glass exactly like it does in the bottle, as the bottle is clear. Really thin head disappears before I set the empyty bottle down. I smell the expected citrus aroma, and nothing else. This is all expected, since I've had Mich Ultra, unfortunately. Taste? Tastes like Mich Ultra mixed with a bit of grapefruit juice. Basically it's terrible.

Thanks to gford217 for the extra and an altogether very generous package of beers!A: A vigorous pour pushes the head up to 1 1/2 fingers. Bright white, foamy and semi long lasting. The body is almost completely opaque, and is a light sun kissed orange color. Lacing is spare.S: The label reveals that Hopzilla uses only Maris Otter malts, which are considered to be of premium quality and price. Terrapin must have spent a fortune as this is one heavily malted DIPA. The caramel component is huge nearly pushing out the lightly toasted bread notes in the background. As the name would suggest, this beer a certified hop bomb, packing every bit of 110 IBUs. Unfortunately, the hop bill is self-conflicted with harsh aromas of Pine-Sol battling with ligter scents of scallion and orange. Heavily soapy. Aromas of peach and fermented pineapple come into play.T: Wow, this is one big beer. Too big in fact, and certainly not in a good way. The malt sweetness is enormous and it somehow manages to ruin the bitterness that I was hoping would counter it. The alcoholic heat is unforgiving. The collection of flavors lacks direction. Not good. I don't know what else to say.M: Medium body with an extremely hot, extremely slick texture. The heat is off-putting.D: I'm not sure what the focus is here.

These promising prospects don't see much follow through in the flavor of the beer itself, with is neither hoppy nor carmel-filled, but rather consists of an awkward fizziness and seaweedtaste. The 'bitter' of ESB seems to have been taken a little too literally and punches me at the back of the tongue with each swig, a reminder that this beer both lack flavor and subtlety. I'm left with a bad aftertaste that is the unnecessary result of an underflavored and imbalanced brew. What would have made this a better brew? ESBs are a style about which I feel rather flexible, but I think that the biggest issue here is the lack of balance between hops and carmel malts.

When I opened the bottle and too a sniff it smelled of dark brown sugars and molasses, spices and herbs; it smelled like a Barq's root beer, and I thought  this isn't going to be so bad, then I took a sip.  First flavors were sweetness, oddly weak root beer flavor consider how strong it smelled, but that flavor was fleeting, next I tasted what can only be described as a terrible beer which quickly turned into a sour flavor.  Now, I love sour beers, but this wasn't so much as a sour, but more like a rank beer, sour alcohol taste, and then the aftertaste, oh God the aftertaste.  That rank beer flavor turned into the most vile sour flavor in my mouth, it was absolutely awful.  I had to get a swig of water right from my tap to wash out the flavor.This &quot;root beer&quot; is an abomination.  I swear to you that the base beer for this drink is the wasted, skunked malt liquor AB has stored in a barely cleaned, rusty storage tank that has been additionally flavored with the empty bottles of Corona (limes included) that the brew master must have been drunk as hell on when he brewed this mess.  My roommate and I immediately dumped the rest of this six pack down the drain ultimately giving us the only silver lining in this entire debacle; a sink drain that smelled of root beer.

Remember this well, as to be able to avoid it all the better in the near future. On the pour it is a thin looking clear yellow hue, okay white head that recedes to a thin ring. However the moment you bring the glass up to your nose the thing doesn't hesitate to bitch slap you. Swilly, cidery, skunky fumes waft up from the glass, keep it away from your eyes. The flavour is horrible, sour old grains, a cidery apple-juice like flavour. This stuff was only made 6 months ago according to the date on the back label. The mouthfeel is thin, but difficult to concentrate on, as the flavour is so bad.

The multiple finger cap is an appealing shade of milk chocolate brown and has a wonderfully bubbly upper surface that eventually leads to gobs of bubbly lace. I had originally planned to mark the appearance down a half point due to the use of caramel color (stated proudly on the label), but I've decided not to.The nose is... what nose? I have never smelled a stout of any sub-type that was this aroma deficient. No wonder the brewery had to cheat by adding caramel color. If the aroma is any guide, it doesn't appear as though they've used much roasted malt at all. Of course, with an ABV that low, I'm not expecting Speedway Stout.I never dreamed that I would run across a 'stout' more pathetic than Guinness Draught, but Lacto Traditional has proved me wrong. The only characteristic that is the least bit stout-like is the color, and they had to add artificial color to achieve that. I wish artificial flavor had been added as well. At least then the beer would have some flavor.The malt backbone... what malt backbone? If I close my eyes, LacTrad SB tastes like an artificially sweetened, mildly ashy, Euro dark lager that isn't really 'dark' at all. Simonds Farsons had to have added caramel extract in addition to caramel color since the flavor profile has absolutely nothing in common with barley malt, roasted or otherwise. A meager milk sugar tang identifies it as a member of the stated style.The mouthfeel is all kinds of watery. Insipid is another word that comes to mind. If any U.S. breweries are considering creating a light stout (Bud Stout Light?)... &amp;lt;shudder&amp;gt;... this abomination should make them think twice. When I saw the ABV and the country of origin (Malta), I wondered what Lacto Traditional would deliver. Nothing even remotely good, that's what. It might be the Guinness Draught of the Mediterranean (my claim, not theirs), but that isn't saying much. My suggestion is to stay away unless you're curious. Don't say I didn't warn you.",

The aroma initially hits me with yeast, then followed by a dank earthiness. Taste? How best to describe it? First mouthful I am thinking &quot;Worchestire sauce? In a beer? WTF? Is 'blonde' french for crazy spices in beer?&quot; It has a weird taste that is hard to describe or place. Not spoiled. Not pleasant. Let's just say that it is not a beer I would ever want to try again. There is a bit of residual sweetness and bready malt and the carbonation is appropriate. Nevertheless: Drainpour.",

Zesty lemon, grassy, and a little grassy hops int he nose. This sucker is mostly malt, and sweet at that. Honey sweet malt taste up front, a little molasses, some malty bitterness. Sugary light caramel taste. Not too complex, no hops or yeast to speak of. Tingly and thick, this beer leaves with a wet finish.I don't think I've cursed in a review, but here it goes: This beer is shit. I could have brewed this myself...with a Mr. Beer kit. I think I did, actually, since it tastes surprisingly similar to the Mr. Beer Canadian Pale, which comes in a can, pre-mixed for ease of use. There are no hops or yeast to speak of in this beer. And I almost left out the fact that this didn't have any head at all. I was afraid of this to begin with, since I don't like Hefeweizens much. But my wife really likes lemon grass so I thought I'd give it a try. This is my first Wheatwine, so maybe I just don't like that style. I don't really know what to think at this point except to advise the Widmer brothers to go back to the drawing board. Just when I was beginning to trust you because of your Drifter Pale Ale, you go and brew something like this. And on top of that, you charge me $10 for a bomber? That's just insulting.",

I picked up a few extra for friends so I wouldn't have to do this alone. 10% ABV in a 40 oz.... Whoever created this is evil.

I'm starting to sweat and get worried. I tip the beer to my lips and take a long pull. It hits me with a ton of sweetness at first. Then I swallow and if feels like paint thinner going down.I'm horrified by the taste of this beer so I approach it from a new angle. Normally I let beer sit on my tongue for a second. The second sip however I open my throat and pour. Wow not nearly as bad. Then I burp and every bit of alcohol I tried to avoid came rolling out of my mouth like a dragon breathing fire. I continued to drink hoping to finish this thing as soon as I could. Suddenly however it hits me like a ton of bricks. I'm drunk. My buddy and I are slurring words slumped over on the stoop outside of my apt.I made it through the entire thing as did my buddy. I took the paper bag off the bottle to make sure it was finished. I threw the bad down and stared at it in a drunked daze. It lay on the ground slightly wet from the sweaty bottle looking very very similar to a used condom. The bottle was there staring at me with the evil eyes on the label and I thought to myself. Why the hell would anyone make this beer and if they did decide to make it why would you put this in a 40 oz.I'm scared to evil eye and maybe to scared to ever trust a homeless buy again.",

You really have to look deep to find some malty notes, but for the most part, it's all raspberries. I'm not quite so fond of the smellTaste - Raspberries with some sour &amp; malty notes. While it's not as sour as the smell makes it out to be, it still comes off a bit on the sour side for my tastes. The raspberry flavor isn't really all that sweet, and it gives the beer more of a grassy sort of flavor. The malty notes here are okay but the flavor does come off as quite offensive in terms of how sour it is. Aftertaste is a bittersweet raspberry and barley flavor.Mouthfeel - Surprisingly light in body, and the carbonation isn't too powerful either. However, the sourness does to get in the way when trying to enjoy this beer and hampering the overall feel on the paletteOverall - This is an example of a novelty beer. It's a beer that people will either love or hate. Sadly, this would be a beer that I would avoid because the flavor comes off as sour and the raspberry flavor comes off as more bland than it does sweet.",

I got another at home to make sure, and yep, I didn't have a bad batch.Now, I like fruit beers a lot, and definitely more than most BAs. This is an embarassment. Usually the biggest problem with fruit beer is that they are over the top, but that's better than missing low.The bottle is great -- &quot;Blackbeary&quot; is cute with a picture of one bear stealing another bear's pie. Poured into a pint glass, is impossibly pale ... closer to clear than yellow, a very very pale shade. Reminds me a lot of Busch Light, I think I'll do a side-by-side test soon. Some big bubbles rising, at least this holds a decent head. The head is the only way I could tell this apart from a narsty macro light.Smell is pleasant but weak. I smell the blackberries, wheat, they are good but barely there.Starts off okay, the blackberries aren't too sweet or dominant and there's a little wheat and nothing else ... and it dies. Halfway through each taste, there ceases to be anything. I had a sad look on my face after each sip .. where'd it go? No aftertaste.Pretty boring mouthfeel. Not exceptionally bad, but it needs more carbonation, more anything. This is especially true as it warms and the lack of everything becomes more notable.Well I was surprised at how quickly I finished my beers, it was close to record speed for a beer I was tasting. This is due to the fact that there was nothing to get over or think about after a sip, and I was always hoping that the next sip would be the flavorful one. So in that sense, it's very drinkable, and this is a rare beer that actually is more thirst quenching in the heat than water. If I were dehydrated in the desert this would be the most drinkable beer ever, especially with the low carbonation, nothing gets in your way. However, there's nothing it offers in terms of long term drinkability ... nothing to find, nothing to analyze, nothing memorable. Just nothing. Especially because I love fruit beers and also enjoy wheats, I am disappointed. To top it all off, this was around $8 /sixpack at beer outlets with normally reasonable prices.",

No freshness date - not even any indication of where the brewery is in Australia, not even the state, save for the website URL on the collar.Amusing piece of beer wisdom on the label: &quot;This beer is best drank from a glass&quot;. Hmmm...Pale amber, clear, almost no carbonation. A very small amount of head stays around the edge of the glass, but other than that head retention is nil. In Australia, the appearance of a freshly-poured beer is pretty important to most brewers (especially the macros, because they don't have much else going for them), which is why it only gets 1.5. In the Outback, any beer would look good - however this beer, despite its name, is brewed in Sydney, where there are plenty of good microbreweries.After initial pouring, the smells are hard to determine because of the lack of carbonation. When I first poured it, however, it had a very strong whisky malt aroma. It also sort of smells a bit yeasty, but to be fair, it's not too sharp or underfermented. Not much hop character at all.The taste is bland - water, a slight hoppy tartness, and that's about it. Might as well have had a hop infusion. Not much to comment on, though not overly offensive in the Chinese macro sense of the word. Mouthfeel is lousy though, since it's pretty much water, and drinkability? Well, it's pretty hot right now, the low thirties this evening, and if I were in Coober Pedy and had a six of this I would be cheering. But I doubt you can get it there, and if I had to bring a beer in, there's plenty more refreshing, substantial, memorable brews to drink in the outback.This beer sucks, and it's an insult to our flourishing microbrewing industry if bottle shops are to stock this beer over any other Aussie micro.

Malt forward with a touch of breadiness, and just a hint of any hop character. Somewhat minerally, almost like blood....scary.The flavor is quite harsh...I'm not sure if this brewed with particularly hard water, or what, but the only hop presence I can really detect is a harsh sort of astringency. Don't get me wrong the bitterness is quite tame, however due to the overall harshness of said bitterness, an almost &quot;metallic&quot; character, it renders the beer quite unpalatable. Aside from the harshness, there isn't really any hop flavors and the malt flavors certainly take front seat, primarily of a caramel variety with a slight husky graininess.Egad. This is atrocious. I can honestly say I will never ever buy this beer again...nor will I willingly except any for free, and that's saying a lot since I'll even drink BMC if it's free.",

So when I don't care for a beer, it's usually a shock, and it calls for a little extra evaluation. But damnit, can't find much nice to say. Here we go:The appearance is the strongest part of this beer, though its beauty is traditional and uncomplicated. Pretty hay color, with a little more nuance than your average lighter beer, and a classic one-finger pour of head. Smell hints at spicy hops and sweet, malty undertones. There is a gentle, piny prickle crossbred with a ruddy molasses. I would characterize the nose as optimistic, but chancy. The two dimensions of the nose are very separate, barely intertwined, which suggests a battle of some sort for supremacy in flavor. The flavor turns up with a disappointing minimum of hops and an overwhelming and uninteresting malt flavor which frankly conjures a narrowly improved Ballantine's. Basically, one-dimensional, and on the sweet side, with notes of...well, college. After a suspicious start, the flavor really puts to rest the question, but it's worth mentioning the mouthfeel.The mouthfeel does its work to elevate this otherwise underwhelming beer into a realm beyond cheap hooch but beneath quality beer. It is richer and fuller than beers I would usually associate with this flavor profile, and the thickened mouthfeel helps separate it out from the really bad stuff.I wondered today while drinking this beer if Pilsners were generally disliked amongst the otherwise beer-loving public. I wondered this question because I can't say many nice things about it myself, and yet, it persists as an omnipresent choice amongst fast-moving shelves at a high-quality price. Judging from these reviews, it seems Pilsner has many detractors. Still, I would love to try a quality version of this style.",

        "text": "* THOSE &quot;WTF was I thinking!?&quot; Beer Moments *So, the other day I was perusing the beer aisle at the Kroger supermarket, and the $$$ on the beers I usually drink was kinda steering me to the cheaper side of things. Or maybe I was subconsciously feeling a little masochistic...I justify my misadventures to the 'This is CRAP!' side of the beer aisle by telling myself, &quot;Okay, sometimes, like, once in a Blue Moon you have to have the CRAP! to renew your appreciation for the good stuff, ya know?&quot; It's rather disturbing how gullible I am when I'm talking to myself...So I selected a 6pk of Yeungling Lager (in green bottles! oh, the blasphemy!) and then looked around for another. I rarely buy or drink brews from south of the border as they're generally too light, too bland, and don't have enough alcohol in them to justify paying anything more than I would for a 6pk of store-brand soda. There are a couple exceptions to the light+bland stereotype, but they're still way overpriced.But the $ on one brew I'd never seen or heard of (oh, you can see where this is going, can't you...), surrounded by all the $$$, pushed me down a road less travelled (a road which should be blocked by a huge pile of Stone Mtn. granite and myriad signs warning of impending doom).The first &quot;WTF was I thinking!?&quot; moment occurred when I scanned the bar code on one of the cans (~fainting~) and the price dropped $2. The second came when I was putting the cans into the beer fridge next to two bottles of Mendocino Red Tail Ale and a bottle of Mendocino Eye of the Hawk Select Ale. I swear, the birds on the labels of those fine, fine brews looked like they were about to fly off the bottles and gouge my eyes out with their talons...The third was when I put a can down on the counter next to my glass and opened it -- my wife said, &quot;What the hell is THAT!?&quot; -- and the only noise was the snapping of aluminum (usually there's a distinct PFFT! and occasionally some light foaming at the mouth, sometimes from the can, sometimes from me ;-). The fourth was when i poured it into my glass -- my wife said, &quot;You're going to DRINK that!?&quot; -- and held it up to the light. I think a few drops of yellow food coloring in a glass of water would have yielded more color than the liquid in my glass.~Sniff~ A light scent of grass, as in dead, dried-up lawn kinda grass.~Sip 1~ Not surprisingly, grass (ditto above).~Sip 2~ Nope, nothing else.My wife said, &quot;WTF were you thinking!?&quot;I should note that in order to discern that grassy scent-taste, I had to extend my senses far beyond normal.It took about three minutes to finish that glass. Unfortunately, there were five more cans in the fridge. I figured, oh hell, I started this punishment, might as well continue, and had another, with a slice of lemon (which didn't help). I switched to a slightly skunky Yeungling after that.Then last night I took the &quot;shandy&quot; route with another one, adding about 1/3 cup of lemonade to the glass. I ended up drinking a diluted, slightly grassy lemonade. I resigned myself to drinking another straight-up, since I'd be wasting lemon slices if I added them. And that was the last &quot;WTF was I thinking!?&quot; moment with this beer, as the two remaining cans will be pushed to the back of the fridge, or donated to (ie, surreptitiously placed in) the neighbor's beer fridge. Heh.Is there a moral to this story? Yeah, it's up in the second paragraph of this post. I should amend that with, &quot;If you're going to force down CRAP!, at least get some decent CRAP!&quot;Now... Guatemala may be a nice place to visit. I suppose it might be a nice place to live. But I hope that Famosa isn't the only beer you've got there. If it is... man, I feel sorry for y'all!",

The head was thin and quickly faded with very little of the oily lacing that I love in IPAs. The smell was equally weak like the color with a very faint hop aroma and no noticeable malt presence. After failing the appearance and smell tests, the taste lived up to my newly reduced expecttions. There is very little hop bite, no malt flavors, and any initial tastes that are expected in an IPA fade immediately to an unpleasant finish. The carbonation and thickness of the beer seem to be in the ballpark of an IPA, but that is about the only &quot;compliment&quot; I can find.I drank a third of the pint and gave up as additional sips showed no improvement.

There is no clove or bananas like I would expect for a dubble. There is some faint distant grassy hops and otherwise, it's hard to distinguish any other aromas. Mouthfeel is slightly cloying with an unpleasant sweet aftertaste and vinous quality.

A little bit of leather in the finish and lingering aftertaste of saccharin. Cleanly fermented. Alcohol is mild in the finish.What a disgusting beer this is. It's nowhere close to being a dubbel.

A bit of hop bitterness and maybe a touch of caramel poked through the sharp edge of this beer, but nothing else. The mouthfeel felt like lemon juice as well, thin and astringent. With the putrid taste, drinkability was virtually nil. The only thing I can see this beer should be used for is bringing something out of hibernation. It could probably wake the dead, or kill some of the living! A souring disappointment.Note: After reading some of the other reviews, it is possible I had a bad bottle. Unfortunately, one was all I had, and I'm not sure of the age. It expired in March '03. I plan to revisit this beer at a later date.",

Lots and lots of soy sauce.T: Some dark fruits like prunes and dates in there, though they're hidden by the huge malt presence.

The smell is terrible and is dominated by acetone and smells like some sort of cleaning chemical. The taste isn't any better - in fact, it's worse. A strong alcohol/acetone/chemical taste dominates all else, with no real malt or hop flavors whatsoever. This beer is the worst brew I have ever tasted and I am extremely disappointed that it is from AR - it is a poor representation of some of the great beers this state produces.",

The foam on this beer is okay, but it doesn\u0092t last very long, leaving behind a thin layer of bubbles across the top of its clear body. This beer offers a light malt flavor that combines some pale malted barley taste with some corn. The beer finishes with only a small amount of bitterness. It is sweeter overall than regular Heineken with only a slight peppery sensation at the end which quickly fades to an aftertaste that combines skunky flavors with sweet malt. Heineken took a long time to finally introduce a light beer and this product, like many other lights, is nothing more than a watery version of the original. I have never been very fond of regular Heineken, so I am even less fond of Heineken Light. I didn\u0092t expect much going in and my expectations were met when I gave this beer a try. This product is very light and offers little taste. It also has the same skunky attributes commonly associated with the parent beer. The taste of corn/cereal grains and skunky hops dominate and the beer is a little too sweet. If I had to write down a list of taste characteristics before I had ever tried this beer, my predictions would have been very accurate. It is basically a glass of watered- down Heineken. It has a clean, crisp look and taste, but there is little else positive to say about this product.",

Its always me... After a considerable attempt at psyching myself up and while telling ryan he has to taste it to finish thre review, I finally got past the smell and hurried took a gulp.

The distinctive Kolsch flavor is only slightly present in Alaskan, making this taste more like an American lager than a true Kolsch. This will be my only 6 for the summer. Hopefully they can bring up the Kolsch flavor next year.",

If you don't think that I am going to be using the hell out of THAT glass, you are so mistaken that you need to go to Beer School!From the CAN: &quot;Tundra Ice Lager Beer [-] Strong Beer [-] Biere Forte&quot;; &quot;Warning: Please Drink Responsibly [-] Never Drink and Drive [-] If You Are Pregnant, Avoid Alcohol&quot;; &quot;No Preservatives [/] Sans Agents De Conservatives&quot;; &quot;Tundra Ice Lager Beer Is Brewed &amp; Packaged By Minhas Craft Brewery&quot;.Oh, yes! My arch-nemesis Minhas again rears its ugly head. I am going to cut them some (just a wee tiny dram) slack on this one since the football lacing and the name are an homage to the Green Bay Packers and the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field. &quot;So what?&quot; you may ask and with good reason. I have never given Minhas anything but the needle, so what has changed? Simple. The Stillers play at the Pack this year and I am desirous of a ticket, so I am hoping for good karma by soft-pedaling my review. The Crack left me with a little splash of beer on my finger, so I gave it a moment to reset and come back up to the line before the Hike &amp; Glug. The glass took the handoff like an old pro and we were off and running. The offensive, I mean, offense mounted a finger of rocky, fizzing, bone-white head before careening headlong into the unrelenting humidity that seemed to blanket the playing field. The new glass, however, was the winner on the play as it allowed the upturned CAN to rest atop it, draining its remaining liquid into the glass. The referee signaled for a return to the line of scrimmage and so I peered in for a better look. The color was somewhere between sunshine-yellow and golden-yellow and rather than call a time-out for review, King Midas and Croesus CANceded the point and went with sunshine. Upon returning to the action on the field, the nose revealed that the cotton CANdy vendor was nearby and I got up to get away from the beer and to see what else might be available, like a noose to hang myself with in the Men's. It was now 3rd Down and I girded myself for the coming onslaught of the offensive, I mean, offense. Wham! Oh, my poor, aching tongue! It spared nothing in coming at me with everything that it both had and didn't have. It had a taste that would make a team of eleven maggots cringe. It didn't have any redeeming value. Suddenly, it began to snow, followed by a brief rain and now we were skidding around on ice, hence its name! I could find no traction and as the kicker came on for the field goal, I feared the worst. Sure enough, wide right! Namely, a wide turn around the kitchen counter and right into the sink and the drain. I wouldn't give this swill to John Randall or any of the other Vikings. Come to think of it, I am not a Packers fan, either, with Da Bears as my secondary team. A round for the home team and I am going home.

It was so thick I'm thinking of keeping a few bottles in my car in case I develop an oil leak.S-I'll admit I like the smell of my own farts and cow manure. This however was worse than those. It was nothing but alcohol, soy sauce. My roommate wanted to try it, I warned him it was awful, took one whiff, did that &quot;I'm gonna vomit all over this granite counter top&quot; and said, &quot;I'm not trying that&quot;T-Words can not describe the taste. Soy sauce infused with alcohol. They say the beer was aged in bourbon barrels, it is more likely that it was aged in barrels that once contained 13 month old milk. After you stomached your first sip and decided to take a 10 minute break before going back, the taste still lingers. M-Thick. Don't have a great grasp on mouthfeel as you wanted to get that stuff out of you as quick as possible. O-I think the best way to recreate this beer is to buy a bottle of soy sauce, add homemade grain alcohol and mix throughly. As the Grinch song goes, given the choice between this and a seasick crocodile, I'll take the seasick crocodile.

Maybe some sugars and alcohol.Mouthfeel/Taste: Very light bodied and drank like water. Hints of some malts and other grains...maybe rice. Alcohol taste was the strongest flavor and that was light. Overall: To be honest, do not care for this beer. However I could enjoy it on a very hot day with no other drink available.",

Warning: Don't drink this beer.It is a limpid yellow color with no head to speak of.It has a bit of citrus aroma.

A sweet, funky taste, I guess better than average for style, but I don't grade too much for style, I grade for enjoyable beer. This one is not. I think to make a beer NA, they must have a flavor and hop filter machine. Unfortunately, the sweetness doesn't seem to be from natural sugar, yeast or fermentation, but saccharin or something. What cracks me up is that it seems like it has the heat of a high ABV beer. Strange.",

        "text": "Went all the way to Arizona to buy this swill.The beer pours a light gold color with minimal head retention and no lacing. The &quot;beer&quot; really doesn't look that bad. On the nose, oh my God, this is flat out horrible. I get corn, rotten veggies, seltzer water and maybe some sulphur. This may well be the worst smelling beer I've ever come across. Flavors replicate the nose, except there's a hint of light american light lager. It's essentially seltzer water, but with a hint of macro swill beer flavor added in. This beer defines the expression watery, with no hint of alcohol in the flavor profile. Calling this swill beer is a stretch, to say the least. There's sort of a &quot;beerish&quot; flavor to the beer, assuming your definition of beer is macro swill. Was initially planning on giving this beer a 1.5 for taste, but as I drank more and more of it (before dumping most of it down the drain), I realized that was entirely too generous. One of the worst beers ever made.... congratulations AB, you've managed to do it again..... and in my humble opinion, trying to cut back on calories and/or losing weight is no excuse for making or drinking a beverage this flavorless.",

        "text": "Drunk straight from a 16 oz. Can from a local Tom ThumbAppearance - I was upset to see on the can that artificial caramel color was added. The color was a light golden tan and was crystal clear. Lots of carbonation at first that quickly dissipated, leaving no head at all. I was hardly surprised.Smell - Lightly sweet apples and nothing more. Not unpleasant at all, but the lack of any beer-like aroma left me hesitant to try it. I knew the brew was going to be sweet, but how much so?Taste - The taste was heavily of apples; far too sweet (like a sparkling apple juice), tart, and artificial (despite the can saying &quot;natural flavors&quot;) and overpowers a weak malt flavor. I tried several times to search for other flavor notes but found only cheap apple cider and weak-sauce macro brew. The finish is sour, boozy and unpleasant. I was disappointed that it didn't have ANY bitterness or real malt flavor at all. If this IS beer, it's beer for people who don't like beer. Completely unbalanced, too sweet, and artificial.Mouthfeel - Fizzy, thin, and watery.Overall - I may be new to tasting beer... in fact I've only had about 10 or so different varieties... but even I can tell you that this should not be a beer. It shouldn't be a hard cider either; it's an awkward amalgamation of cheap cider and macro brew that does not mix or balance well. Whatever beer taste may exist is overshadowed by the taste of artificial apple. As a rule of thumb I don't buy any brew that has commercials, and this only strengthens that guideline all the more. But hey, when they're on special &quot;2 for $3.33&quot;, what did I expect? My cousin had the other and swears it's the best beer he's ever had, but then again he's accustomed to cheap macros and sweet malt beverages.Thoroughly disappointed, will not buy or drink again. Shame on you Miller for tricking me into buying a nasty hard cider.",

As soon as I poured it, I knew it wasn't going to be as good as others. The color is not as hazy as a hefeweizen should be. I was actually able to see my fingers through the glass. It did have a nice body, as it was still slipping down the side of the glass by the time I finished. The smell was a little bitter, as was the taste. I don't mind bitter beers, but hefeweizens aren't supposed to be bitter.Overall, it was rough to drink. I bought one six pack just to try it, and I'm sure I'll only buy one six pack in my lifetime. If you want an excellent hefeweizen, try Widmer Brothers",
