        "text": "750ml bottle into Chimay chalice (why not?). Bottled June, 2008 according to the cork (it's March 2010 now if you can't read the posted on date of the review). Chimay Blue was actually my eye-opener craft beer. I've neglected it for several years (if I get Chimay, I go for Chimay White personally). Time to go back and see if my &quot;beginner's palate&quot; missed anything.Appearance: Moderate pour yields a half inch, fizzy and pillowy off-white head that dissipates slowly into an active, bubbling mound in the middle and around the surface of the beer. Neither head nor the beer leave much lacing. Pours a deep, deep ruby that's almost opaque, with visible bubbles rising in the middle and some sediment floating around even in the first glass. Smell: Belgian yeast, raisin, plum, grape, clove, some floral character, and a tiny hint of earthy funk. Aroma shifts more towards woodsy grassiness and grape as the beer warms.Taste: first sip: deliciously deep rush of sweet raisin and plum, transitioning to a big note of Belgian yeast, then moving to a deepening of flavor too big and fast for me to keep up and identify it all. Overall impression is that it's fruity, spicy and smooth. Finishes a little dry, with some warming alcohol present from early on in the glass. There's a smooth, almost chewy hit of roasted malt like a good stout in the transition from the huge carbonation in the middle to the slightly bitter end. Chocolate notes come out as the beer warms. All the elements from the nose are present in the beer, along with dozens of other random good flavors lurking around and popping up from sip to sip. While each sip is different, each sip is also balanced. Sometimes it's a complex rush of equally strong dark fruit notes and clove, sometimes it's just straight plum to Belgian yeast to roasted malt, but the flavors are always harmonious and complement each other.Mouthfeel: A beautiful, medium-bodied combo of creamy and juicy. Very carbonated. Drinkability: Great beer to sit down and savor. I'd imagine it pairs well with some Chimay cheese. Alcohol is present but not overpowering, though it doesn't really matter; 1 350ml or 750ml bottle is enough.My last impression of Chimay Blue before I stopped drinking it was &quot;Annoying, way too fruity, overcarbonated mess.&quot; I guess I have changed a bit since then, because Chimay Blue is world class. I think the carbonation, dryness, and deep dark flavors were probably a bit too much for me when I first started getting into beer. Whether I've changed or misremembered or whatever, I love it now. It's one of those all too few beers that gives you some crazy, novel combination of flavors in every sip, each one interesting, palate-pleasing, and satisfying--with real *character* in all 4 of the objective BA rating categories. It's probably time to put Chimay back into regular rotation for me.",

Had it on tap 2-3 months ago and was not at all impressed.Sure loving it now from a 6 month old bottle, bottled Dec 1, 2010A - DARK brown, almost black - excellent head retention, lacing and very active still in the tulip. Swirls bring up a sold one inch head that sticks around!S - very good but when warms, fantastic. Chocolate caramel brownie soaked in brown sugared Bourbon.T - Matches nose but add some Oak, rye bourbon and vanilla, molasses and a wee bit of liquorice. Bourbon integrated perfectly. Does not overpower, nor take a back seat. Let's the complexities of the verticals still shine and make their place known.M - I wanted to give this a 4 because I'd like more of a velvet softer stout mouthfeel with this one but it's not a stout. It's a Strong Ale and Phuck. The mouthfeel is about as good as it gets for a Stong Ale friends...O - At the $11.99 price tag a STEAL! Other Breweries take notice. I wish I had another to age another 6-12 months. *EDIT* Now that I'm finishing this gem...it really is one of the better Bourbon Bal-aged beers out there...grab one if you can. Easiest Bal-aged bomber I've ever finished...could kill another if I had it.Recommended for sure.",

Big sheets of lace stick to the glass, and leave lots of arcs behind as they slide down into the abyss. The head shows excellent retention and never dipped below on finger. When I hold this one to the light, I can see some dark purple-brown hues. Nice.S - Rum-raisin cake and raisin studded scones. This smells like date and raisin embedded bakery goodies, prune juice, fruit cake, chocolate chip cookies straight from grandma's oven, and tootsie rolls. Beautiful.T - Dates, prunes, raisins, rum balls, and Tootsie Rolls. The flavor is really nice, but lacks all of the bakery nuances of the outstanding nose while keeping the rum and dark fruit notes. There are some nutty, toasty flavors after the swallow which I like a lot. M - Medium bodied (light for a doppelbock), tight, and a little boozy. This feels focused and firm, which is sort of a good thing since beers of this style can be a bit flabby and sugary. Carbonation is very subdued, and the finish provides a bit of hops and some EtOH warmth.D - A very drinkable brew indeed. It's darkly fruity, rummy, a bit boozy, sweet, yet really tight and focused.

Looks like a pretty beautiful kriek to me.Nose gives Brett, and also that specific Brett strain that gives a pineapple character. Lots o' pineapple. There's also a creamy, almost confectionery character to it. Now I'm getting some sour cherry, but it's as though it was dusted with some icing sugar. Pretty Kriek-y on the whole. Reserved cherries and cheese. Note: there's a subtle cheese character which grows with time, almost closer to non-blue cheese than most other sours/lambics I've had, almost like brie, or a creamier rather than blue cheese although it still has a blue cheese character to it.Taste is not sour, at all. You think that's exactly the direction it's heading with the appearance, nose and when it initially hits your tastebuds with a fizzle, but it doesn't go to the sourness. It becomes bitter. The bitterness predominantly mitigates the sourness. What is this wizardry- rye malt, hops, or something else?Mouthfeel is a mildly sour, slightly rye-y sort of mineral-y thing. I really like this minerality of this-it's unique and quite drinkable. It's almost got the bitterness of anise or something. Real cleansing bitterness in the finish, as though you never had beer on your tongue.Pretty unique beer and very much worth trying for how it confounds expectations.",

This is definitively a lager with just a hint of the roasted malts that make it unique.M: Full-bodied and finishes nicely.O: These small-batch experiments by craft brewers, while usually interesting, don't turn out this good very often. The Coalminer's Dark Lager is a great brew, and I would love to see Fort George make room for it in their regular line-up or at least as a seasonal.",

        "text": "12 oz. bottle with one of the best looking beer labels out there. The label is that of Ralph Steadman's smoking cowboy image of Hunter S. Thompson. The best way I can describe the picture is that it's a picture of a smoking cowboy with it's head as a skull that's saying &quot;OK! Let's Party!!&quot; The skull is connected to the skinny torso by the means of a very long neck. The smoking cowboy is holding a Cigarette in one of those Cigarette holders in his right hand. To the left of the smoking cowboy is another picture of a desert setting and in this desert is a tall monument with a red fist at the top. To the right of the smoking cowboy is the Govt. warning and a Vintage year in the lower right hand corner, with mine being Vintage 06A. This has one of the best labels out there and it's something you need to see for yourself first hand. Appearance: When poured into a mug, the beer was a jet black color. When I say jet black, I mean jet black. I held it up to the light and everything, there was no light coming through what so ever. The head of foam was a bit disappointing. It started off a little skim of tan colored foam and then rose up to maybe at most half an inch. As fast it came up, it went back down again into just a few rings and barely any lace around the glass. Smell: It had a not too overwhelming smell of roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, and a pinch of bitter citrus hops at the end.Taste: To me it was very unique. In the beginning I could taste the roasted malt and roasted coffee beans. Then I noticed a not too sweet taste of dark chocolate with a hint of caramel to it. If that wasn't enough, then out of nowhere comes a not too bitter taste of bitter citrus hops to balance it all out. It was unique to me in all aspects. Before this I haven't tasted anything like this before.Mouthfeel: I would have to say that this beer is full bodied, chewy, and with an aftertaste of bitter dark choclate. I'm surprised that this has an ABV of 9.2% because I really couldn't taste it, let alone feel it.Drinkability: It's too bad I didn't buy this in a 4-pack because I could really go for another one right now. This is another beer that I would definitely buy again in the near future. This is one beer you need to see and taste for yourself. This has to be one of, if not the best beer Flying Dog makes.",

Here's a winter warmer a hop head could fall in love with.The beer pours an almost viscuous looking amber orange color with very good head retention and lots of sticky lacing. On the nose, one is quickly transported to hop heaven, with no detours along the way. This beer is incredibly floral, with a huge, perfumy hop nose of citrus and flowers. There is some underlying spiciness as well in this lovely beer, which only further adds to the attraction. For the most part, the flavors on the palate replicate the nose, though they're not nearly as pronounced (I mean, how could they be?). However, there is still plenty of citrus and spice in this beer, with the malt presence no more then an afterthought, with just enough to keep the hops in balance. The beer has a fairly light mouthfeel, and drinkability is very good. I'm impressed that Double Mountain was able to get this much flavor and richness in this beer, and yet still keep the abv. at a reasonable level. Another excellent beer from Double Mountain. Maybe the best thing yet I've had from them.",

Lot's of citrus especially pineapple and grapefruit zest. Then of course the, inescapable alcohol smell is present but very pleasant and warming.T- WOW! Massive Hop Flavor, sticky pine and sweet citrus all together with a very warming alcohol presence. Even at 41% the alcohol does not overwhelm the other flavors. Everything is pretty equally intense.

As expected you can feel the booze heat up the as I swirl it in my mouth.D - Well there is only so much you can drink safely but if a serving is only an once or two (which is what it should be) then I could definitely have at least one more.

The taste is just terrific for the style. Many times saisons can come across as slightly skunked (often because they are), but this beer is crisp and refreshing with a sweet smoothness that is completely void of any hint of bitterness or spoil.

A very good beer, the smell was muted, the taste was awesome, mouth and drinkability very good. I tried it when it first came out and there was more sweetness, now it is on the bitter side.",

It's been years since I last had a bottle of this, but damn if it still doesn't impress.The beer pours a slightly brownish orange amber color with good head retention and lacing.  On the nose there is considerable sweet malt, coupled with a lovely light vinegar (the stuff you get at an English pub for your fish and chips), a hint of dry citrus, and a whisper of dry sherry as well.  The flavor profile is more of the same, with the sweet malt flavor forward and dominating.  Even so, the finish is clean and fairly dry, with a light kiss of bitterness at the very end.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied at most, but damn if this doesn't deliver considerable flavor for such a low abv. beer.  Absolutely delicious, and it just goes to show what years of experience crafting great pale ales can bring to the table.  Most of the time I want something with a bit more hoppy bitterness these days, but even for a hophead like myself, this was a beer that was easy to enjoy and appreciate.  Really quite impressive.",

This beer is extremely clear looking; they must've really gotten into that irish moss for this one.s: smells wonderful, perfectly hoppy in every way; floral, fruity, citrusy, herbal, piney, spicy. Followed by traces of bready malts, this beer says &quot;I'm going to taste f**king delicious!&quot;t: sweet hoppy flavors hit the palette first, followed by a bitter dry hop flavor. The malt flavor is suppressed quite a bit by the hops, but a bready biscuity flavor lingers and holds on for dear life, hoping that it even be noticed. (I really got into that line, I know, ha)m/o: mouthfeel is good, nothing making me say it's THE BEST, but it is damn drinkable for a dipa! These are my favorite imperials: the ones that are incredibly hoppy, but still maintain drinkability to the fullest extent, and aren't overly bitter. This beer truly was a surprise; I seem to have worked my way on the southern tier totem pole starting at the wrong point. I started with gemini ($9/22oz) and was somewhat disappointed for the price, then I got the oaked unearthly ($8/22oz) which was much better, in fact, great, but still so pricey. But lo and behold the southern tier 2xIPA for ($10.5/72oz) is my favorite! Do yourself a favor and buy this beer before splurging on a bomber, or maybe even the regular southern tier IPA.",

It's got a noticeable sweetness, a broad palette of &quot;fruity&quot; flavors, and a warming alcohol prescence that hides itself and is perceived as a &quot;spicyness&quot;. The real difficulty with this particular beer is taking in the breadth of flavors that are available before one has consumed too much of the stuff to be all that perceptive. This might be the central paradox of beer tasting, or at least Belgian beer tasting.

It's as opaque and lightly fizzy as regular BCS.The beer smells and tastes like a much less abrasive version of regular BCS. Or like a BCS that's aged 4-5 years. It's one of the least coffeeish coffee stouts I've ever had, like somehow the black coffee took a rough, bitter RIS and made it sweet and smooth. The whiskeyness is barely there, and while it makes the beer more drinkable and more appealing (I assume) to a general audience, it turns out that I actually really enjoy the pain of a regular BCS. But judging the beer on its own, it's a pretty remarkable achievement to make a beer this big tastes this smooth. Starts out with a tiny hint of whiskey, with a small burn that lasts throughout the sip. This moves into a milky, chocolately mocha, moving into the rough and lightly sour grain of a medium-strength porter, and this porter aftertaste is all that's left once the beer is swallowed. Very good, and definitely worth trying, but I'd honestly prefer a regular BCS.",

It is remarkable and definitely &quot;partakable&quot;. Approachable would be another good describer. An original mountain recipe? Full of chocolate flavor that follows a very dominate sweet rich vanilla dominator. Very good porter. Not watery, a good roasted profile that includes dark chocolates and a subtle coffee profile.

However, now that I've drank half the bottle I found the date stamp and it confirms my suspicions: this bottle is 11 months old. As a result my findings are going to be a little different than fresh obviously but I've enjoyed it anyway so I thought I'd rate it up. A: Deep and dark version of orange with a light beige head with good resilience and decent lacing. S: Green pine, earthy citrus was what I thought of. May not make literal sense but paints the right picture. T: Well, here's when the age is apparent - it's got a great maltiness with light caramel and even some vanilla. The hops are there but definitely muted from fresh, and I don't get great resolution on the type of hops anymore. It's primarily citrus at this point, though - grapefruit and pineapple I think. This beer is really sweet now, both from the hops and malt side. M: Very creamy and mouth coating for an IPA. It's slightly dry on the back end but mostly just creamy now. O: I've never tried this fresh, but I'm pretty satisfied with it for being nearly a year old. Some IPA's will develop into interesting &quot;mini-barleywines&quot; if cellared, though most will just kind of fade into nothing interesting. I think this one does a lot better than most.

Drank one from the can, another from a snifter.A - I can see why Alchemist encourages you to drink from the can. Heady pours a muddy amber, not the least bit of clarity, with a surprisingly robust fizzy head. The odd yeast floaty is visible. Resembles White Oak Jai Alia or Burton Baton, or some other barrel-aged IPA.S - Now the substantive argument for drinking out of the can. Crap the top and you're smacked with a barrage of grand aromas: pine needle, passion fruit, tangerine and doughy malting. What's amazing is how each note is distinct and sharp. Really assured. Poured in a snifter, the nose dissipates quite a bit.T - Heady is more salad than stew. The IPA flavors are bright and they don't so much meld as dance off each other. The grass, grapefruit, and lemon flavors are held together, it seems, from Alchemist's proprietary yeast and the slight malt back. Sweet and earthy, tart and succulent.M - Dances that fine line between substantial and refreshing. This is a deviously drinkable IIPA.Massively tasty IPA. I can simultaneously understand the fanaticism surrounding it and am perplexed that people speak of it as a total mold-breaker. What it is is incredibly well-made.

In that way, it is well-balanced. The finish has enough hops to create bitterness. The body is below average with a moderate level of carbonation. Overall, a smooth porter with just enough smoke to make it interesting.",

But judging by other posts on here this is likely very very similar or the same thing.Pours a rusty, reddish, tan murk with grainy and small light tan head that dissipates quickly. First thought at smell, and appearance, it may be similar to Scaldis Noel. Looks similar, just... muddy. Not pretty, but I always have high hopes for this brewer and have loved all from Smisje (Smiske) so far.Smells of damp wood, warm booze, a bit of vanilla, citrusy caramel tinge. You catch a hint of Belgian candi sugar... a very unusual earthy, yeasty presence which is fairly common for this brewer. Unusual all around, but I like it in an odd way.There is a whirl of spice going on as I taste. A little nutmeg, a little dry cinnamon maybe, pepper and some other things I have trouble really connecting or putting finger on. There is a toasted raisin sort of taste. Toasted, dried dates. There is a tad bit of caramel, a little vanilla. The candi sugar sweeps in on the middle and follows through until it dries and bitters out lightly on the end with sort of a herbal hop character. Earthy and yeasty with the sugars. This is on the sweeter side but not too sweet. It is actually pretty well balanced and the booze gets lost among the other things going on... but adds to the bitterness I think. Has a nice warming effect with the spice.Reminiscent of Scaldis Noel for me... but better. I think the yeast and spice profile is much more interesting and adds a great deal more complexity to this.Mouthfeel is very nice. Not sticky, a little dense, but the carbonation scours away and lightens things up a bit. Pretty spot on. A nice cold/snowy spring evening beer. Surprisingly easy to drink for the high alcohol content.As it warms it really blooms. Overall, I wouldn't consider this a Belgian Dark... Definitely a Belgian Amber. Definitely fits all those characteristics much better. On my love affair with Smisje, I may be a bit bias... but, this is one from the brewer that is not high on the list. It's awfully good! Don't get me wrong. It just doesn't surprise you and intrigue you quite as much as others. The quality is impeccable though. No one can deny the quality of this beer. I only picked up one when I saw it, and double of others. I'm satisfied that I did one and would definitely grab up another should the chance arise. But I wouldn't stockpile this like I do some of the others... (COUGH -calva reserve!-)",

        "text": "This beer pours an opaque (at least in relatively low light), dark brown with a fine beige head that puffs up well and leaves good lacing. The color is darker than I was expecting. The nose is refined brown sugar, malt and good fruitiness of the plum/nectarine variety. I prefer the aroma to the flavor, which adds in a relatively strong phenol note. The flavor come together a bit like Ommegang's flagship Abbey Ale, for my tastebuds. I'm not a big fan of the Abbey Ale (for some reason, I think it tastes like soy sauce), but Brooklyn pulls off the flavor profile well in this beer. It's a hard beer to judge against its style because it's a bit stronger than the Belgian versions that I've tried. At any rate, the mouthfeel is smooth and fairly creamy. The drinkability is high because it's really an excellent beer to pair with food. It's a strong, relatively unique flavor that doesn't dominate the palate. I can understand why the French Laundry would want to add this beer to their menu. Anyway, it's all fun to find a Brooklyn Brewery beer in California.",

        "text": "We crack a bottle, pouring a brew of rich golden amber into our Great Lakes pints. It holds a one and a half finger tall head of chunky sandpaper colored bubbles, showing great retention. Vertical stones of lacing jut to the lip of the glass like crooked teeth. Haze is present, as is a fine suspended sediment. Carbonation appears to be active. The nose gives floral and herbal hop freshness, cucumber and watermelon rind fruitiness, pale and lightly wheaty malts, freshly cut grassy resins, mineral and metallics, pungent bready yeastiness, honey, citric and grapefruity flesh and juiciness, white grape juice, toasted marshmallow, and soft, watery adjuncty grain with warmth. Our first impression is that this is a great IPA, with nice toasty to the malts, freshness to the hops, and solid, even drinkability. As we sip, the taste opens with cotton candy sweetness, souring grapefruity and lemony hop bite, floral hop infusions, white sugar, candied apple sweetness, cheap pale maltiness, granite, nutty oiliness, paper towel, and ground black pepper. The swallow comes to a peak with coconut husk, pomegranate seeds, chicory plant, light campfire smokiness, seashore sulfurs, weedy vegetals, citric and grapefruity hoppiness, and buttercream icing sweetness. The end washes through with nicely warming booziness, black pepper, phenolic chemical bite, aloe, lactic creaminess, soapy hops, lemon fizz, tangerine and cherry flesh, foamy plastics, pale malty breadiness, and pumpernickel mineral heaviness. The aftertaste breathes of buttery biscuits, metallic and bready pale malts, sourdough yeastiness, lavender oil, dried oregano and basil, gritty mineral, vegetal skins, grapefruity hop rind, lemon tea, clothy tannic twang, booze, dried herbs, dirty mineral water, and sappy pine needles. The body is smoothly medium, and the carbonation is medium. Each sip gives excellent slurp, smack, cream, froth, foam, pop, and glug. Finishing pop is wet, crisp, and pleasant. The mouth is left creamy and coated, with eventual dripping wetness into astringent chalkiness and light citric puck. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks very nicely.Overall, the best thing about this beer is how it has a hedgehog on the cover, as that animal happens to be a big inside joke between the two of us. In all seriousness though, we very much enjoyed both the taste and the feel of each sip. The flavoring was fresh, clean, and cheap, but in a good way. It sloshed back easily, while delivering fully on the flavor, and in cleanliness of sip, with softness, creaminess, and foamy froth to the mustache. This was accomplished much in the same way that Founders All Day IPA found success, with ease of drinkability, lightness, and easily explosive flavoring. This brewery has continued to impress us more and more with each release, and Spiny Norman is no exception. He drinks just as well as his competitors, and we feel happy to have made his acquaintance. Hopefully we will see him again soon.",

        "text": "22 oz. bottle as an AWESOME extra courtesy of a great BA - thanks! Poured in to a cervoise.Appearance: Pours a treacherously dark black cherry, opaque without exposure to direct light, though doing that does allow a few tendrils of luminescence in around the edges of the cervoise. The head on top of this beer is equally dark, relatively, a one finger mass of seething foam that has fairly poor retention, a not-unexpected effect of the 13.3% abv. The fast fade does reveal a huge amount of fast, pinpoint carbonation surging forth from the depths of this brew, rising up the sides and to the surface of the beer and - pop! - popping on the surface. Lacing on the sides of the glass is non-existent, again I suppose due to the ridiculously high abv% - its almost like any semblance of foam that does pop up with agitation or successive sips is trying as hard as possible to return to the body of this beer, racing down the sides of the glass back in to the depths. Attractively hued and forgivable, process-wise, due to the high abv%.Aroma: Glassy and steely, with that &quot;well-attenuated barleywine&quot; smell that's vaguely malty and moderately astringent and bitter. The hoppiness is pungent here, particularly as it warms (though this, unfortunately, is where the alcohol begins to come through more strongly as well) - tropical fruits, papaya, grapefruits - though it mingles well with dark toffee, faint cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses and the other hop notes ... mint, tobacco, faint thyme. Taste: I was pondering out loud why this beer comes across as &quot;hotter&quot; than, say, the Perfect Storm, which theoretically should be this beer plus a bunch of whiskey. Thinking too much on the subject, I'm going to move forward on the assumption that when my tongue tastes whiskey or bourbon and the accompanying heat, my reaction is &quot;hm, this tastes like whiskey and bourbon, and these things are supposed to be alcoholic and hot,&quot; whereas when I taste, say, a non-bal beer, the alcohol spiciness stands out a lot more, in contrast, as I don't associate, say, barleywine flavors (always) with heat. This is a long roundabout way of saying this beer has plenty of alcohol heat, unsurprising with only a year or so of age and a 13.3% abv bill, but prominent and slightly detracting nonetheless.The rest of this beer is classic dark/light barleywine. It's dark in the sense that it's a heavily caramelized, glassy tasting barleywine - dark toffee, dry molasses and caramel notes, faint suggestions of toast, brown sugar. It's equal parts dry and sweet, hitting that nice balanced sweet spot that itself strikes the perfect balance with what's a pretty darn hefty bittering hop bill. It's light in the sense that the hop flavors here are on the higher end of the spectrum, as are the malty fruit notes - tropical fruits, citrus, cherries, peaches, as well as a ton of leafy tobacco notes. The end result is a biting, tongue-thrashing barleywine with a great deal of complexity ... and enough heat that I'd recommend laying this one down for at least another two years before cracking it.Mouthfeel: Thick and oily, but with enough fine, subtle embedded carbonation to provide a good amount of lift. It's not syrupy or sticky, as the body itself is relatively dry ... but don't let this one sit for too long.Drinkability: This is no Perfect Storm, in name or in flavor. I think part of that's in my head, what with the increased harshness/bitterness from the alcohol, but also from the lack of balance that the barrel aging contributes. Regardless, I'm still pretty impressed by this beer - it's a well-made barleywine, with tons of complexity and flavor, with tons of dark leafy hop notes and dark, steely malts, and with tons of sweeter, fruitier, lighter notes. This one has the potential to be beautiful with a year or two of age on it - if you got it, sit on it, and if you got two, sit on one and send me the other. Cheers!",

Taste: It's called the monster, but there's nothing scary here. Instead, it's hops. Neither bitter nor overly floral, the taste is instead earthy and rich. The brewer lists Simcoe and Willamette as the hop varieties, and they are delicious. The finish is smooth, malty, and sweet.Mouthfeel: Very good. I might prefer a touch more carbonation. Overall: Don't drink it when on the water, but try it anyplace else. Hopefully the monster returns next year.",

Slight cascading bubbles and a deep dark opaque brown-black body.Aroma is coriander, yes, but so much more. Really a licorice candy smell- a little floral quality, I'm guessing from the hops. Still mossy and grassy like so many SWHs but deeper and more layered.Fantastic smooth sweet flavor, spicy and peppery. Licorice/coriander show up huge, this is truly a spiced beer. Burnt malts turn it into a varied affair, layered from sweetness to spice to bitter.Mouthfeel comes off properly carbonated and really slick. Not sticky or too heavy. Nice.A very great beer, especially for this style, which I don't love or hate.

When the beer was poured into an imperial pint glass, a thick and rich rocky tan head formed, then settled after a minute into a thinner but darker brown blanket, leaving thick lacing. The beer itself was impervious to light, except at the thinner bottom, where some deep ruby was seen to shine through. The nose was loaded with notes of ripe plantain, dark chocolate, sweet banana, and molasses... an intersting contrast to the nose of many of the top American imperial stouts. The taste was highly influenced by the nose. A mellow roasted malt base holds up flavors of molasses and dark chocolate, with subtle suggestions of banana coming through in the lingering semi-dry and well-bittered finish. The body was a little thin for an imperial stout, but wasn\u0092t too detrimental to the overall experience. As this was a toned down imperial stout, not in flavor but in body and alcohol content, it was very drinkable. Overall a solid and fine tuned piece of work, sure to please most stout lovers, but may dissapoint junkies of Expedition, Speedway, or Storm King Stout.",

Appearance: As served the beer is a rich dark reddish brown color with a \u00bc\u201d creamy tan head that slowly recedes to leave a ring and irregularly shaped island of thin foam on the surface of the liquid. Sipping produces a nice layer of foam that breaks up into patches and legs of lacing as it slides back down to the liquid. The ring and island of foam persist to the end of the beer.Smell: The soft aroma is filled with the promise of hidden fruits, mostly dark fruits like plum and dark cherries. There is also a bit of spice here that brings to mind things like cinnamon and ginger.Taste: The flavor is filled with bready, lightly spicy candi sugar sweetness that is broken up nicely by a certain amount of tart fruitiness from the dark fruits. In the background there is some semi-sweet chocolate and the spices found by the nose.Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is on the light side of medium bodied with some barely detectable carbonation for most of the beer. The finish slides from the candi sugar sweeness into the tart fruitiness and then trails off to a lightly grassy, slightly bitter dryness in the back of the throat.Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this one quite drinkable and an easy sipper with each sip leading naturally to the next. I\u2019ll certainly be happy to have this again and may even decide this year or next to order a case and have it be my Christmas beer for the season.

The pepper is immediately apparent on the back of the throat, with some warming vanilla following in the finish. Astringency, whether from the roasted malt or the tea, is present from front to back, and marries well with the pepper notes. Again, a slight sourness is present, becoming a bit more lactic as the beer warms. Three very distinct and conflicting flavors that were played to play nicely. You've got to dig to find them, but very interesting. M- A bit on the thin side, especially for the style. D- Even with the high alcohol, it is VERY well hidden.

This is a pretty dark red beer with a medium head and nicely carbonated. It had a bread-like aroma, very pleasant. The taste was malty, with some sweetness leading to the hops.

        "text": "On tap @ Troegs Brewing Company on 6/25/09. Served in a pint glass. Pours a beautiful clear copper with a thin head of off-white foam. Good retention here, which stays frothy, throwing a cascade of foamy lace up on the sides of the glass. The aroma is fairly floral and piny, and VERY citric smelling, which mixes with the sweetness of the malts to really impart a sharp tang in the nose. Very light spicing and warmth to this as well. The taste has a nice sharp hop bite to it up front, coming off as a bit more spicy and resinous than the aroma did. Actually the bitterness in this is pretty intense at times, laying a heavy lingering dryness on the palate. That same tangy mix of citrus and caramel malts from the aroma is present, helping cut the initial hop blast and then slowly fading into the background to enable the bitterness to shine. I wouldn't say that the balance was excellent in this but it's pretty darn good. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fairly sharp feel to the carbonation that makes the hops pop that much more and pretty much staying that way the whole way through. There is a touch of beef to this, not a whole lot, just leaving some light warmth on the breath. I had two pints of this and it caught up to me quicker than I thought that it would. Solid hoppy fix here from Troegs. Nothing really spectacular for me but overall solid. The drinkibility of this for 7% is pretty killer though.",

The beer was served in an Imperial Pint glass.Appearance: The beers body is black. No opaqueness to light just dead blackness. The head is a finger and a half high. The head has a nice tan coloration. Fantastic head retention it stood up to the mustache and thats usually a head killer. The beer left a pancake batter of lacing on the side of my glass. Smell: Nice layers of vanilla oak riding a sea of dark roasted, charred and toasted coffee malt aromas. Dark cocoa dipped raisins and berry fruity tones waft about. Well done! Taste: This delivers the dark roasted and charred layers of maltyness I craved. Dark roasted coffee and dark cocoa combine with a flash of vanilla oak sweetness. The alcohol peaks out for a half second but is quickly swallowed up by the roasted and charred malts. Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is full. The carbonation is low but matches well to the character of the beer. No alcohol is noted in the mouth. No hotness to the beer. This is a dangerously smooth easy to drink beer. The head rush I am experiencing would have been the only clue I had that this beer was 13%. Well played!...",

I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s said like \u201cor\u201d, but then \u201cor\u201d doesn\u2019t work with an \u201cL\u201d after it... \u201cTo Orl\u201d? (someone from Scandinavia help a brother out here!). ANYWAY I\u2019m expecting another tasty drop from this gypsy brewer - To \u00d8l certainly doesn\u2019t f**k spiders (to coin a popular Aussie bogan euphemism) when it comes to brewing, so I\u2019m expecting BIG flavours without compromises. Their DIPA Underground was like a punch in the pancreas for me and I\u2019m hoping this being 8% ABV (instead of 8.5% of the DIPA) will mean that the sugar content isn\u2019t so diabetes inducing... here goes!Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.A: Spectacular cloudy Harvest gold body with a firm and slightly creamy half centimetre white head that leaves some lace scrawl on the side of the glass. Bit darker than the average Saison, but this is To \u00d8l so all bets are off. 8/10.S: Brett funk from the get-go which leads on into a floral/earthy and an acidic noted aroma. There\u2019s nothing outstanding about the character of this Saison, it could be a Belgian Saison if I was blindfolded. Waiting for something to jump out I noticed a slight hospital disinfectant touch lingering in the background... weird or am I overthinking it now? Perhaps that\u2019s the band-aid smell other craft beer reviewers have noticed - I\u2019ve never noticed it before, huh, I get it now. 7/10.T: That acidity noted above is ever present here - herbal bitter lemon throughout the profile. Starts out with a hint of Brett funk (barnyard character as I like to call it), follows through to pepper/floral/earthy notes... actually this is one of the easiest drinking 8% brews I\u2019ve had. Balance is sublime and no alcohol noticed in the profile. Pretty damn tasty... too damn tasty! Aftertaste has a slight menthol note - Aha, a hint of alcohol! 9/10.M: Medium bodied with a nice dense/creamy carbonation, goes down like liquid-silk (patent pending). 9/10.D: Kinda glad this doesn\u2019t come in a 500ml can (or 750ml corked/caged bottle!) as it\u2019s dangerously easy-drinking this one. I finished the bottle like it was a soft drink, I\u2019ve struggled more with light beers than this one. If you\u2019ve ever liked a classic Saison and thought \u201cI need to get drunk a little bit quicker\u201d then this is the meal ticket for you. To \u00d8l nailed this one. 9/10.Food match: Chicken is your main meat with this bad boy.",

I've become a fan of Jolly Pumpkin and was happy to see it and even happier to drink it. Review is from notes taken on 11/18/2010 and poured from the bottle to a tulip.Appearance: Pour is a moderately light coppery/orange color; starts with a full 2 finger, thick, off-white head with great retention; body is a little cloudy, but still shows strong and fast tiny bubbles of carbonation plowing through the body; the only lacing is left behind from each sip and is made up of tiny spots and one fair swath. Smell: Definitely a JP beer with that funky brett and tart fruity/saccharine sweetness; nice sweet pumpkin mash and pumpkin pie spiciness (nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom, etc.). Taste: Interesting to say the least -- the pumpkin aspect and spiciness blends well with some tart and citric apple-esque acidic flavors; brett funkiness is definitely present and adds to the tartness; beyond the brett, the time in the barrel doesn't seem to be having too much of an affect on this one, aside from perhaps a bit of a vanilla-sweetness that blends in with the pumpkin and pumpkin pie spicy flavors.Mouthfeel: Body is light to medium in weight; carbonation is present and firm, but not sharp; a thick and semi-dry coating is left on the roof, but, at the same time, the cheeks are left moist and the mouth feels like it's watering just a bit; not as puckeringly tart as some of JP's other beers, but it does have just a bit of that bite to it to keep it interesting.Drinkability: Not bad and it's a nice seasonal treat that I was happy to get a hold of. This is one that I don't think that I would want to try to age as I feel the spiciness would fade out too much and it would become a bit boring. Nice flavors that keep it interesting and a solid, fun mouthfeel... While it's not something that I would reach for on a daily basis, it's definitely something I'll look forward to again.",

        "text": "Picked up a bottle of this at a BCLS earlier this wonderful evening. Unfortunately, Driftwood doesn't yet date their bottles, so I have no idea how fresh this is. Given that this IPA is somewhat hop-heavy, that is somewhat important and should probably be rectified sooner rather than later.I'm fairly familiar with this beer. Actually, I guess I should rephrase that: I thought I was familiar with this beer. It had a nice hop profile and proved to be really easy drinking for being 7% ABV, although as time went on, I found it to be somewhat bottom-heavy. The initial mouthfeel was great, but the aftertaste was a bit too bitter and not as crisp as some of the IPAs I'd had from the golden land of Californy. In the interim, I even took a trip down to San Francisco in January and overloaded on some pretty amazing IPAs and DIPAs. I came back to BC thinking that BC IPAs would never compare to the stuff I'd had down there. For the most part, I was right. Central City IPA was a bit too malty and I had to double check the can to make sure I didn't pick up the ESB on accident, the hop profile being less impressive than I had remembered; Switchback IPA was better, with a nice hop profile, citrusy and piny and crisp, although it had a very familiar beta acid bitterness on the end of the aftertaste.And then I finally found a bottle of Fat Tug IPA. I approached it with apprehension. Before my trip to CA, I viewed it as a great IPA -- one of the best brewed in BC, alongside Hop Therapy (different classes, obviously). I didn't want to ruin that impression. As it turns out, my fears were completely misplaced, because this is an even better beer than I remembered it to be. I'm not sure if it was just because I had a really fresh bottle (and with BCLS, it's really hard to tell, not to mention they don't refrigerate their beers) or they tweaked the recipe or what, but it surprised the hell out of me.The appearance is a somewhat hazy golden amber with a pretty great off-white head and lacing on the glass. The initial smell is a gorgeous citrusy hop smell, with some bready malts way at the back. The taste is really crisp citrus hops. As you allow the taste to permeate, you begin to notice a fairly solid malt backing that adds a great balance to the beer (something that I'd never really noticed before). The aftertaste was surprisingly light and fairly crisp. Like I said, this was pretty astounding to me as I remember the aftertaste being a lot heavier and way more bitter but, again, I'm not sure if it's just due to the fact that I had a really fresh bottle or if Driftwood tweaked their recipe any. Driftwood plz add bottling dates to your IPAs ok thanks :(Overall, I'm really glad I revisited this beer. It used to be really good for BC IPAs, now I can say with certainty that it's better than most of the IPAs I've had in the Pacific Northwest and maybe only a notch or so below the best (single) IPAs found in Southern California. This seems like a somewhat back-handed compliment but it really isn't. Trust me.Edit: as of March 2013, Driftwood has started printing bottling dates on the cap of their beers. Truly the Best Brewery.Edit: as of July, 2016, ehhh. I feel this IPA has seen better days. I feel it used to be the flagship for the BC scene, but, I feel like it's becoming outdated once again. I still think it's an enjoyable beer, from a personal point of view, but I've had so much better from around BC - Juxtapose, Frank IPA from Machine Brewing, Fuggles &amp; Warlock's IPAs (Cannon IPA, to start with - and not &quot;officially&quot; an IPA, but their Icarus Mosaic Saison is basically a single-hopped farmhouse IPA, and it's one of the best things I've had in BC since Nectarous)Anyway, my point is, I'm gonna have to re-adjust the rating for this beer a bit. It's still damn good, and I still go for it when I feel like a chewy IPA to graze on. But it's no longer my standard.",

I will buy many of these and cellar most of them, but I really wanted my review of IRS to be a fresh bottle. Poured into my Stone Imperial glass. This is so thick there is no &quot;glup, glup&quot; in the pour. I don't mean to sound cliche but... really. Black color with black highlight and I think the black highlights, have black highlights. Head is a grand three fingers of super soft, root beer float looking, dark brown colored delight. The head subsided after quite a few minutes and leaves a beautiful sticky lace.Smell is so roasted!! Burnt coffee, bitter dark chocolate, even some charred wood smells. I also easily pick out boozy smells.Taste is so goddamn fantastic. This is pretty complex and must be broken down by regions of the tongue. The first taste that my (poor over worked) tongue tastes is the sweet of chocolate, but that is quickly overcome by dark roasted coffee and then some bitterness from the freshness of the hops, now after that I get just a bit of tartness, that is still sweet, like maybe a maraschino cherry. The throat at the end of this gets an alcohol fireball. The mouth is simply fantastic. This is an Imperial Russian that has been in the bottle for maybe a month and is as smooth and rich as anyone in the style. Chewy is definitely an adjective that comes to mind when I swallow this fantastic rendition of the style.Overall I must say that I feel very lucky to live on the West side of the country and have pretty easy access to this.

Aromas of lemon, tangerine, pepper spice, grass notes, a bready backbone, and subtle piney highlights. Flavors are insanely balanced, with a grassy and lemon sweet blend forward, followed by tangerine, orange rind, pine pitch, and subtle pepper spice. All of these characteristics are riding on a bready backbone. The body is smooth and light, with a subtle crisp and dry feel at the end. The aftertaste is grassy and bitter, with the citrus notes being subdued slightly. Smooth, slightly dry finish with a lingering bitterness. Great beer.",

I do not care who has made this beer, I only want to drink it, and to drink it in good company. 4.5 paws.Taste - Dark fruit, baker's chocolate, and coffee preside.  Only the slightest bitterness lingers, with a touch of alcoholic burn on the tip of the tongue.  The finish feels as though there are flakes of unsweetened chocolate clinging to my mouth, only to be sept away by swig of milk. 4 paws.Feel - Velvety, and almost fractional resting on the tongue.  The mouthfeel may be the best part of this beer, resting like a blanket, unassuming until you finally take notice.  I had never discovered nuances contemplating the mouthfeel of a beer, until I contemplated this one. 4.25 paws.I am a firm believer that one should always judge a beer by its style.  Brown ales are most certainly not my first grab when I am perusing the beer aisle.  They are not exciting like a fresh IPA, wild ale, or barrel aged offering.  But they most definitely are an important part of Beerdom (this should go without saying).  This is an excellent offering of what most would consider a boring style.  I am not likely to revisit this beer in the near future as so much of my beer budget is tied up in the &quot;exciting&quot; offerings, but it is an exceptional beer nonetheless.  4.25 paws.Meow beer.",

There are a ton of flavors going on here. This brew had a sweetish beginning, reminiscent of a sweet cappucino but also with notes of raisin and licorice as well.

Nice lacing of mocha colored crema lining the glass. High viscosity is apparent.S: WOW, smells like burnt rye with burnt caramel. Opening up to a huge vanilla 'n smoke profile. Extremely rich, toffee  bar with the most sinful chocolate cake you ever ate topped with a ice cream sandwich. YikesT: the texture is soft and welcoming. Very toffee rich and loading with vanilla concentrate. Very consistent front to back. 13.8% WOW, that's generous. F: Full bodied with a velvety softness that is quite delightful on this cold winter day.O: Damn, I was going to be hard on this one but I see what the hype is all about now. This beer is everything you want out of a high percentage stout. Huge viscous aromatics that almost seem to stick to your nostrils coupled with the deep char, bourbon, and vanilla overtones on the palate. The mid-palate is mindboggling, concentrated flavors and full bodied texture. Not very many high octane stouts keep you going back for more, this one does.",

        "text": "Well, well: Fraoch Heather Ale, at last we meet - I have been wanting to sample this brew ever since I started reviewing beers and heard of the Scottish Gruit style. As I have always had a fascination with ancient history the idea of trying one of their original beers (Fraoch has been brewed for over 4,000 years) has managed to burrow its way into my soft grey matter like those brain worms from The Wrath of Khan. Now it's finally time to feed my brain worm.Poured from a 500ml bottle into a St Feuillien chalice.A: Presents with a hazy light Tangelo body and white soap bubble lacing that dissolves into a ring around the glass.S: Flowery and fruity with a honeyed malt base. The flower notes are camomile and honeysuckle. The fruit notes are overripe pear and nectarine. A very pleasing aroma, quite sweet but nonetheless enjoyable.T: Hmmm, it's different, in a great way - flavour is honey dominant without being overly sweet - if you wanted to taste a beer with the essence of honey this nails it. Those overripe pears and the flowery heather also round out the palate. The finish is a light medicinal herb bitterness with a dry vinous touch.M: Mid to light bodied with a light carbonation.D: The more this brew warmed up (I had it in the freezer - it was ice cold) the more spice flavours came out, such as mulled wine spices. Also the after taste was nothing like any other brew I've tried - a bit of herbal funk. This was a unique experience, however if I have better access to this beer it would easily find a place amongst the regulars - an excellent drop, air do shl\u00e0inte!Food match: Roasted pig on a spit with a honey-glaze, roast carrots, potatoes and fennel - your typical medieval fare for an ancient ale.",

This settles down into a thin creamy retention that skims the surface, leaving a nice looking thick coating of spotty lacing and brown oils behind. This was definitely one of the darkest Porter pours that I've ever seen. Just a great look here. The aroma is quite dark and toasty smelling, with a dominate roasted malt presence and coffee notes adding a definite bite to the nose. Thick chocolate and caramel sweetness form a beefy smelling undercurrent that raises this bouquet up. The taste is very similar to the aroma, with an even balance between the roast and sweetness in this. Dark roasted chocolate malt character imparts both a toasty bitterness AND thick sweetness to the profile, while accents of acrid coffee and sweetened caramel adding an extra layer to the taste while still evening each other out. Finishes with a trailing mix of malt and bitterness that hangs lovingly on the palate. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied with a lower feeling but still smooth carbonation that gives off a nice thick feel in the mouth. Wow, the lingering roastiness of this is just great!

Did not expect the power of the resinous hops from the canned beer, even after being prepped by the smell. Big hops, but not very subtle either. Almost (but not quite) overwhelming. I wish there was a bigger malt profile to balance the hops.M: Nice and chewy; medium body that supports the astringent hops.D: I can imagine having too many of these, but the hops are so pronounced that one will usually be enough.",

A: Pours a very cloudy, murky,  soft orange color with a creamy 1/2 finger white head. Not a very appealing beer at first sight. Looks like grapefruit juice. S: Alright, now we're talking. Big, fresh-squeezed mangos. There's also quite a splash of grapefruit aroma, likely from the hops. No detectable honey in the nose. T: Big, tangy grapefruit and tangerine notes up front. Surprisingly, mango not my first thought in the flavor, it's more in the aftertaste. Finishes strong with mango puree flavor, almost like a smoothie. Very sweet and juicy. M: Big, full mouthfeel for a DIPA. The mango puree and honey really smoothen this beer out and make it go down like mango juice or a smoothie. Very acidic, too.O: So, compared directly to Square Grouper, I do not think this beer is an improvement. The mango puree addition sounds nice in theory, but just doesn't nail it in practice with this one. It makes it too sweet, too acidic, and takes away from the robust hoppyness and crispness of the original. However, this is still a really good DIPA, and right up there with the other great PW DIPAs like Citra and Rock Bottom. It's just not as good as SG. Recommendation: Grab one if you can find it.",

The finish is not as dry as i would like, but this does make it a bit smoother.

Midway through, there\u2019s a slightly mineralish taste. The malt backbone provides some toasty notes and keeps the hops from being too overbearing. Make no mistake, this tastes like a hoppy pale ale, not an IPA.The body was best described as \u201cmedium,\u201d with a perfect level of carbonation. I know something that is 6% abv isn\u2019t an ideal session beer, but damn me if I don\u2019t want to try! If I were to encounter this on-tap at one of my locals, I\u2019d probably stick with it all night.",

As such, the Ayinger was another solid brew.Poured from the 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass and got a nice, fluffy white head with moderate lacing. The beer itself is a murky orange color that is not affected when holding it up to the light. Translucent at best, probably closer to a cloudy opaque, though.The overpowering smell is that of banana. There are some wheat smells and a thin aroma of malt. There may even be some spices in this, but the banana is what lingers the most. I had a friend walk in while I was sampling this and his words were: &quot;Damn, that beer smells awesome; like a really ripe banana&quot;, so I guess his words echo mine.The taste is very comparable to the Franziskaner Hefe-Weiss Dunkel - I really can't tell the difference between the two and if I did a blind taste test 100 times, I probably would struggle to get it right. That being said, that's an excellent taste. There is a taste of malt and spice once the brew warms, but it's very typical Hefeweizen style taste. Impressive.Mouthfeel was a little weaker than the other comparable brws. The carbonation was good, but it was more thick than I thought it should be considering the lack of complexity in this brew. Still above average, but probably the only thing that brings it down.It's a very typical beer and very easily drinkable, even in the 16.9 oz variety. I could drink plenty of these and enjoy it.

        "text": "This session IPA by Sierra Nevada has 4.5% ABV and 35 IBUs. The name comes from the scale used to measure the density of the liquid. Look-It pours a clear golden yellow with a smooth foamy white head. The lacing is thick and persistent. Smell-The aroma is delicate yet pleasant. I get a light honey-suckle malt aroma with some pine and grapefruit. The malts are almost cracker-like and the hop smell is subtle.Taste-The hops pop out first with their refined pine flavor being a bit more noticeable than the grapefruit. Although there is a grapefruit rind flavor that lingers after each sip. The malts take backstage here which is interesting, because the aroma indicated strong malts. The mouthfeel is light-bodied, thin, crisp, and easy to drink. The carbonation is pleasantly fizzy.Overall-This is a refreshing beer to drink any time. I really like the hop profile and how refined it is. These go down quickly as a result.",

A thin ring of tiny bubbles rests around the edge of the glass. No film on the surface and no lacing at all. Black as hell, there is no chance for light to penetrate.S: A true malt bomb. There are big fudgey, sweet chocolate syrupy notes on the nose. Lightly roasted with a woody quality to the hop character. A deeper inhale and the scent of well conditioned leather is uncovered. T: Extremely well balanced on the palate. The flavor components replicate the nose closely and is slightly more successful. Nothing new is brought to the table per se, just complete reassurance of the quality of the beer that I'm drinking. The 11% ABV is buried from a flavor standpoint, and isn't noticeable until a warming sensation begins from the belly up. The alcohol then lingers throughout the drinking experience. M: Very sweet, semi astringent on the tongue and a somewhat drying finish. Amply smooth carbonation gets rid of any would-be cloyingess.D: [Drinkability] Very good stout with excellent flavor and mouthfeel. Not being a huge Lost Abbey fan, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this beer. Would definitely order again.",

Taste, wow the taste was incredible love the way it went down.  No coating or ill after taste left behind.Look, as dark as night, poured it and really enjoyed it.  I'm not a true beer snob yet but this beer was awesome it was recommended to me by La Rivera Market and Spirits and it didn't let me down.  They recommend drinking a few and ageing the rest and that's what I plan on doing.  Cheers!",

Smell is nothing what I expected from the look, hops hops hops, citrus, pine, burnt roast, coffee. Taste mirrors the smell, lots of layers to this beer. Yep the taste is pretty spot on with the smell grapefruit and other citrus comes forward more on the taste. I can tell the alcohol is defenitly there but its not offensivly high at all, fits perfect. The mouthfeel is thicker then a IIPA but less then an Impy stout. By the looks of it you would expect a chewy beer but the carbonation smooths it out, with a taste and bitterness that lingers long after each sip. Loving this beer, I wouldn't mind if this replaced SSR in their regular rotation and I love that beer. Its SSR on the juice benching 520lbs for reps.",

It was one of three different vintages poured at this excellent festival.I've had this beer on a number of occasions, and while it's always quite good, there's little doubt the beer has benefited from a few extra years aging. This beer always has a very pronounced hop profile, but the extra time has softened it a bit, giving it a much smoother/softer mouthfeel. Excellent lacing with good foam head retention in this beer. Lots of vanilla, caramel and toffee on the palate. This is still a very big beer, but the aging process has softened it to the point where it's way too drinkable now. This beer is considerably lighter then it's younger siblings, but still has a very nice light brown/amber color. A beautiful beer, if not my personal favorite at this festival.",

She said back in Greece they drink a lot of German beer but Mythos is a fairly popular beer of Greek origin. Also, please keep in mind this is my very first review. Upon popping the tab on this can and pouring it into a pint glass the color is a clear light yellow color. I would say the carbonation is moderate. It had a very bubbly fake looking white head that had very little retention. It has a very clean and clear looking appearance with few carbonation bubbles. I guess typical of this style.When I bring the glass to my nose I find myself bored immediately. I get a slight hint of sweet malt, however it is very subtle. The smell also lacks hops, I am trying hard to pick up on something, I would say grassy if anything. I am disappointed in the aroma.Upon taking the initial few sips I find this beer very dull and bland. Again, sweet malty flavor but very weak. Hardly any hop bitterness or hop flavor of sorts. There is absolutely no complexity to this brew.Mythos feels very wet and watered down. I would say very light body if you can even call it body. Again I would say moderate carbonation. But now that I have had it in a glass for a few minutes now I know it is going flat rather quickly. As far as drinkability goes, it goes down easy. I would not recommend this to an Aficionado, but those who have yet to discover better beer may find this refreshing and enjoyable. I would not go out of my way to try this beer again. I have tried very hard not to let my love of hops and malt interfere with this review. But I enjoy and respect complexity and this beer had none.

Oranges have a stale quality (maybe it\u2019s the mixing with the moderate hoppiness) and while not completely precise it kinda smells like oranges that came from a trash dumpster. If I smelled this orange character I wouldn't eat the fruit and I just don't think the burnt+orange character goes well together at all.T: Again, the intention to bring orange and black together (The Giants colors and this beer celebrates them winning the 2011 World Series) doesn't make sense on a taste level. The orange character actually stands up against the substantial burnt/roasted character, but to get it up to those levels the orange flavor isn't very natural. Its slightly like orange pith (not too bad), but also like orange concentrate (bad). Part of it is that its too sweet overall. After that initial collision and both of those flavors somehow subside, and a tinkle of citrus hops show through but then the fake orange comes back with an awful vengeance to finish out the sip over a thin veil of clean roastiness that remains quite sweet. This is perhaps the worst orange quality, fake almost to the point of plastic. I don\u2019t think its because 'fake' oranges were used per se, its more that to get the intense, clear orange intensity they wanted the flavors come off as 'concentrate' in a BAD way.Notes: Go Giants, but let's not be so literal in the orange/black interpretation next time. Highly unique, but please don't copy it.",

Coconut and marshmallow are accompanied by glue and solvent notes. I'm shocked this is only 6.5%. There's a hint of chocolate and peanut butter in the background, but I'm not getting much in the way of traditional doppelbock malt flavors.T - Taste is redolent of oak, alcohol, nail polish remover, and light coconut. Starts cloyingly sweet but finishes astringent somehow. Strangely boozy for such a low-ABV offering.M - Bizarre - there's actually zesty carbonation here, even though a hard pour failed to rouse much in the way of bubbles. Thin and watery body that is somehow tannic, dry, and chewy at the same time. The strange juxtaposition of incongruous textures mirrors that of the flavor profile. Less warming alcohol than the taste and aroma suggested.D - Wow! This was one of the most mind-blowing bad beers I've had in a long time.

Bottled Sept.2004, part of a 12-pack sampler from the brewery.4.0% ABV, 9 IBU.Hefe Proper? That takes alot of balls to call a beer that, and I can tell you from within milliseconds of cracking open this brew, it's NOT A &quot;HEFE PROPER&quot;. Pours out to a cloudy pale golden, requiring a hefty pour to achieve any semblance of head. The retention is exceedingly poor, dashing away in seconds, and there is absolutely no lacing. Carbonation is moderate to mild. The aroma?...Hrmm, smells like something that may resemble &quot;Beer&quot;...a touch of Cascade hops....thats about it. No cloves, no bananas, no German Noble hops. Hefe proper my ass. Mouthfeel is exceedingly sour and sharp with a light body. Taste begins with a TON of lacto sourness, followed by a distinct wheat graininess, a very odd sour chemical bitterness, and suggestions of husk in the aftertaste overshadowed by funky sour metals. Is this beer or yogurt or bile!? Hrmm, can't tell!Completely off for the style, this is an absolute embarrassment to Hefe-Weizens and beer in general. I've had alot of &quot;American Style Hefe's&quot; (which I vehemently loathe) but this one takes the cake as the worst...EVER. Can you tell I feel strongly about this beer? This beer is a complete and utter disaster...a horrible mistake, a quagmire of horrid bile!. Seriously, this beer tastes like spit-up...like you just threw up in your mouth and swallowed it.

Ah, the WSLN days.The sips are an extension of the aroma - peach tea with alcohol. The barrel characteristics are ok for what they are - modest char and oak with a soft tapering of bourbon.

It is capped with a beige-colored head that vanishes quickly into a big-bubbled collar and beads of film on top of the beer. S: Whoa. This is surprisingly, and off-puttingly, malty. I enjoyed fresh Old Guardian last year, so I picked this up right when it was released, hoping to capture the same vibrant hop freshness in this year's version. Alas, no. Up-front aromas of toffee, molasses, and caramel. Hops are *secondary* (I never thought I'd say this about a Stone beer in a non-hop-shortage year), producing a floral, roselike aroma with citric qualities. T: Multi-grain bread, caramel, molasses, toffee. Some dark fruit notes that are intertwined with floral hop flavors. The citrus I picked up in the nose is absolutely buried here. An incredibly simplistic, imbalanced flavor that delivers none of the delicious hop freshness I expected from this beer. M: Boozy, syrupy, and thick. The carbonation seems to be similar to years past, and the booziness is sort of what I'd expect from a big beer this fresh, but the syrupiness detracts a lot, here. D: I drainpoured about 17oz.

Carbonation is a touch low but within acceptable parameters (though I doubt Six Sigma devotees would be amused).

No lacing. 3/5Smell- Sweet cola aroma from far away. Maple donut dominates with a imitation smoke flavor in the background. The smoke aroma, although small, is not pleasant after a minute. 2/5Taste- Here is where the smoke takes over. Not in a good way. The sweet maple donut that was in the aroma is in the background this time. Shame. The smoke makes this a beer that is only interesting in very small doses. A little goes a long way. The after taste is atrocious and stays with you long than you wish it to. 1/5Mouthfeel- Not a thin mouthfeel per se, but I think it would benefit from a little more feel. 2/5Overall- A novelty of a beer for sure. That is about it. I would not recommend. I have had the maple bacon donut and liked it, but I think that is because it had actual bacon on it and not an imitation smoke flavoring that you buy at the grocery store drizzled on top. The label says it is brewed with bacon, and smoked malts, but it comes out as an imitation flavor. 1/5",

Then again, that depends on your definition of beer.Let me rephrase that, a McDonalds hamburger is still considered a hamburger. In its essence, it IS a hamburger. It has beef, it has condiments, it has two buns. But is it something that you'd personally feel good about showing off to ones friends as ones life contribution to society? No, no you wouldn't.I'd have to say that there are two ideas about success that exist in the world of beers today. One says that the best quality beers will fill what niches they will, and that their qualities in ingredients make them the best. The other says that that the beer that the most people drink is the best drink around. Bud Light has succeeded in one of these categories. I doubt if it could ever succeed in both. I doubt that Burger King or McDonalds will ever make a burger worth a five star restaurant, and I doubt that Anheuser-Busch will ever turn Bud Light into anything more than a beer for the masses of those who have no idea what real quality beer should taste like, but that should not take away in the least from what AB has accomplished. Hopefully, the world will change someday to make what they have done irrelevant. Please, let it be soon.",

Light grainy scents pop out from time to time. T- This is a kiwi-strawberry sweet explosion. The beer itself is overly sweet and almost as sugary as other flavored drinks. Some light cereal grains in the middle that die out fast as the kiwi-strawberry come back in front. Light alcohol flavoring in the backing...more sweetness than anything which just goes along with the overall flavor. M- Light mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Kiwi-strawberry left not only on the palate but long into the aftertaste with a hint of alcohol. Flavors are kiwi-strawberry forward and no real off flavors just sweet artifical kiwi-strawberry. Light alcohol drying on the palate.D- This beer was terrible. It was sweet and full of artifical flavoring. Simply gross and even more sickly sweet than I would have liked.

It was a real hit or miss situation then as it was unpasteurized and supposed to be volatile (!). When it was good, it earned the praise of US Presidents (Nixon kept the Whitehouse stocked with it) as it's massive creamy taste and light body just rocked everyone, which led to the Coors mystique. When it was bad, it was almost drain-pour material, like we have now. I attribute the loss to mass marketing as the formula changed to the &quot;Banquet Beer&quot; when Coors rolled out across the States in the early 80's. I was in North Carolina at the time as NC State's Wolfpack was approaching NCAA greatness and the new shipment of Coors sold out every night for two years. This sample was found at the supermarket in a tall can with the &quot;frost brewed liner&quot;.

The ivory colored head is the consistency of stiffly beaten egg whites and looks good sitting atop the average looking beer.The nose is borderline nasty and has a distinctive aroma that I've smelled in other beer from this brewery. I've previously attributed it to the organic nature of their offerings, but I've now had too many organic beers that didn't smell like this for me to believe that theory any longer. India Pale Ale smells musty and spoiled even though the bottle is barely four months old.Hops are partially successful in fighting through the smothering blanket of repulsiveness. The significant hop bitterness and marginal hop flavor are the only things keeping the rest of this bottle from going down the drain. Magnum, Crystal and Hallertauer is an odd hop bill for an American IPA, so I doubt that I'd love the flavor profile even without the pervasive presence of pesticide.The beer tastes like rotting vegetables and clay with a disturbing phenolic foulness. It isn't easy separating the hoppiness from the underlying nastiness since the latter infects every aspect of the flavor profile. Hmmm... could this be what infected beer tastes like? Although there isn't much wrong with the mouthfeel, what does it matter at this point?I know this bottle of Wolaver's India Pale Ale is reasonably fresh and has been well cared for. That's because it was hand carried from the brewery to me when it was less than one month old. More's the pity (and the sheer, stupifying wonder) that it tastes so bad. I'm still willing to give Otter Creek/Wolaver's more chances, because a good portion of what they brew is decent. But this one? Never again.",

The vital stats on the Bud Ice are 2.23 BA rating, 5.5% ABV and $1.97. The corresponding stats on the Natural Ice are 2.03 BA rating, 5.9% ABV and $1.38. Maybe they're different after all. Also, both were started out at my beer fridge temperature of 50 degrees (I know, I know... ). Let the fun and games begin.Clear, light, bright gold. The descriptions for beer and head are identical because these two beers look identical. There isn't one scintilla of difference in the appearances; they might as well have come out of the same can.They have nearly identical noses as well. Both are underpowered and this one smells of sweet, husky grain and mildly musty hops. To their credit, neither one has any semblance of skunkiness that some (yes... fresh) macros can have. I know that it isn't actual, light-struck skunk, but it's nasty all the same.As noted in the Bud Ice review, Natural Ice has a bit more flavor and is sweeter with a less pronounced graininess. Again, some nastiness has appeared as the beer warms, but it's equal between the two and is managable. As long as I don't let them warm too much before this cage match is over, I should be okay. This beer's body is also light, but the mouthfeel is helped a little by what I presume is a higher sugar content.Natural Ice is my preference based on more flavor and (marginally) better flavor. I've successfully determined, to my own satisfaction, that there's a difference between these two beers, even if it's subtle. Best not to mess with success if you're A-B, right? Looks like I differ from the collective wisdom of the BA community on the relative merits of these two, but at least we (almost) all agree on one thing. Bud Ice and Natural Ice are both bad beer.",

Regardless of category or style - this beer is bad.Poured a 12oz. bottle into a pilsener glass.Appearance - It produced a one finger white head which linger for about 20 seconds before dissipating to a thin halo around the glass. It is a pale straw yellow color - as though someone soaked hay in water overnight. It is completely transparent.Smell - Like grainy corn. I can't smell any hops. Very adjuncty. Taste - Ugh. Very cereal-like. Like mildly alcholic water that had Cornflakes soaked in it. Grainy corn and adjuncts. It has a metallic flavor as well - funny considering that came from a bottle. Mouthfeel - Carbonation level? No, seriously, I am wondering - where is it? This is like drinking dirty water. Obviously on the lighter side of light bodied.Drinkability - As far as the ability to drink lots of this in a short time it would get a 5. Sure, you could do it, but why? This is made for chugging at parties. On the desirability aspect of drinkability - it would get a 0 if I had the option. If you have ever consumed this beer and you frequent this website, you know it's bad. If you have to drink a lite beer, reach for a Sam Adams lite. It is the only light beer that doesn't make me want to vomit.",

The beer choices were, well, limited.Poured in a glass, Coors Light has a pale, bubbly light yellow color and a fluffy little white head that evaporates immediately. The smell was faintly of pale malt and a hefty dose of corn syrup. The taste was initially syrupy sweet but turned wretched in a matter of minutes as the beer warmed a bit. The bitter, metallic taste was enough to make me stop after just one. The feel was light and overly carbonated, like a malt/corn soda.I should have followed my instincts and brought along a sixer of Bell's or Three Floyds. I didn't and my palate paid the price. Considering the other options were Corona Extra and some malternative, C.L. was the least of the three evils. Next time I'll just drink water.",

A sizzling two finger head formed, and rapidly collapsed to a flat surface.S - Some grassy and pine aromas can be detected but are otherwise cloaked by smoky and medicinal odor. Very off-putting smell.T - The taste is strikingly medicinal and a bit sweaty. Not hop-forward in any way whatsoever except for a firm and lasting bitterness which would make for a fine finish if the hop flavors were not erased by the medicinal quality.M - A decent mouthfeel with just enough carbonation, but somewhat tingly and numbing.D - Undrinkable, sadly.

I find it hard to believe that dozens of different variations are even possible when it comes to beer like this. I guess minor changes in sugar content and ABV are enough to earn new can graphics. Anyway, on with the show...Amber with a generous splash of orange; definitely the darker of these two combatants. The head is bone white in color, a finger or two smaller and doesn't look as good as the head on the other beer. The early lead goes to Camo Silver Ice.The nose reminds me of apples macerated in grain alcohol. I still don't think that beer of this style (even the worst examples) smells as bad as the worst macro lagers, but that's just me. In any case, this one isn't likely to win any prizes.Neither one of these two is anywhere close to good beer. I mean that in a general sense and when compared to the best malt liquors out there. Jaguar is excessively grainy and is more boozy than malty sweet. It may not be possible to brew a high gravity lager with such a high ABV that's worth a damn. I'm pretty sure I've had some decent ones though.Who really cares about the mouthfeel in a malt liquor? They're both par for the style course, with a medium-full slickness that doesn't quite reach sticky. Zippy carbonation keeps things moving along without feeling overly fizzilicious.Malt Likkapalooza VII has not been a stellar showing for either one of these brews. Jaguar has the cooler can, so that counts for something. Of course, it doesn't really matter since the brown paper bag will ensure that the can graphics can't be seen anyway. Bottom line: there may not be many cheaper ways to get drunk, but there have to be more pleasant ways.",

BRIGHT-FUCKING-BLUE in the bottle with golden foil surrounding the cap. Tell me what beer geek can pass THAT up? Yeah, didn't think so...Two: It's brewed in Guatemala. Three: Single purchase at Drug Emporium in Huntington, WV. On to the beverage: the color is abhorrently blue--picture the water at a mini-golf course. No head, clear body. Stains the tongue. The aroma suggests a mix of festering cabbage and hot garbage juice. Maybe some over-steamed veggies and corn-sugar sweetness, but that's almost a stretch.The flavor does little to correct for a god-awful start. If anything can be said to possibly rectify this beer, it's that the flavor isn't TOO off-putting. Still, there's not much taste to be had. The mouthfeel is carbonated; the body, thin. Leaves a bit of sticky sugar on the back of the palate. To say this was an experience would be an understatement. I just hope the drain doesn't stay blue for too long after I pour the remainder of this beer down it.",

Bumped it up from a dead-last 1.0 to a 1.5 because it was slightly amusing to watch head on a &quot;beer&quot; drop faster than it seemed gravity itself could pull it down.Not a hint of hops aroma, and even the corn character was barely noticable. Flavor was one with the aroma, more noticeable for what was not there than what was, left a slightly dry, alcoholic aftertaste with an astringent bitter edge to it. I suppose this stuff is really quite drinkable because there's so little to it, and as long as it is ice-cold your taste buds will stay numb.

I've had scottish ales with more hop characteristics than this beer. Their website claims 60 ibus...but again was more on par with a scottish ale.

Big blobs of carbonation lazily drifted to the surface.A sniff, then another, and I can't get anything to register on my olfactory radar. Finally, after a couple more efforts, I catch a faint whiff of husky malts and sugars, almost like a kid's cereal. The taste certainly seemed like a kiddie cereal. Sweet pale malts, a vcorn-like quality and sugary sweetness had me thinking I was drinking Frosted Flakes. No discernible hops bittering but a lurking astringency and faintly metallic bite in the finish which turned brackish. The feel was light and quite crisp.Every once in a while I find myself overcome by the urge to try something I know I probably shouldn't.

The head is disappointingly small; an aggressive pour only yielded a one finger light cream color. Having said that, the retention of the dinky head is excellent, and the lacing left down the glass is beautiful.S: This one seems malty. Very little hops are prevalent aside from a hint of balancing pine; it's mostly biscuit, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, butterscotch, and marzipan on the nose. It comes off like an English-style IPA - and not a great one, either.T: Uh oh. As soon as this hits the tongue, a wave of nondescript, generic bitterness scrapes the tongue harshly at first. It's just about the most unpleasant grapefruit-forward hop profile I've ever encountered. This soon gives way to another massive wave of diacetyl and (seemingly) battery acid. And then the bitterness becomes medicinal. And then the general flavor profile becomes metallic. And then the nasty hops intermingle with the buttery malt/yeast and becomes vomit-like in flavor. And then I get the urge to drainpour this. And then I retch after choking down another swig of this stuff. And then I drainpour this for real.M: The texture doesn't seem so horrid at first...right up until the sharp coarseness of the body and unpleasant dryness brings out the nasty bitterness in the worst way possible. It even feels gross beyond just the flavors.O: Welp, I think we found a gold standard for how bad an IPA can get - it tastes like 'crappy homebrew' levels of bad. I'd even surmise the year-old bottle of Torpedo I've got stashed away would be better than this. Avoid like the plague!",

I know there are people who probably have a palate for this but I am just not one of them.It does look impressive, like black tar. No head (it's gotta be at least 10 years old by now) and completely pitch black. A black hole.The smell is pure brandy, liquor with serious, major alcohol. There is probably maple and lots of roasted barley, but all of it is dwarfed by the alcohol. Call it Sex Panther, pure gasoline.The taste, again, is like taking a shot of brandy or bourbon or hard liquor. The reason I drink beer is because I don't like the taste of liquor, so I'm not sure why brewers would try to make beers that taste like liquor. This simply doesn't taste good to me. It's got some burnt fruit and raisin flavors, but more kerosene. I am seriously plugging my nose to drink this stuff. As many have noted, tastes like soy sauce. It's honestly like drinking blood.It's thick all right, thick like chocolate milk. If this thing were at least thinner, I might be able to choke down more than just a sip at a time. I would never have this again, and though I could probably develop a palate for it over time, I don't want to have to do the work.Again, I know that it's popular to enjoy these &quot;extreme&quot; beers, but this one just does not taste good to me. Not drinkable, not worth it. I have had Dogfish Head 120 IPA and although I didn't love it, I sort of admired the artistry of it. This one does not strike me as having anything redeeming. Any thoughts I had of buying Utopia (just to say I've had it) just went right out the window. As much of a &quot;snob&quot; as I tend to be regarding beer, I would rather drink Coors Light all day long than be subjected to this again. Sorry Sam Adams, I enjoy most of your beers, but this one doesn't do the job.",

The foam thins but retention is pretty consistent once it settles. Impressive lacing on most of the glass.The smell was questionable right after opening the can &amp; it hasn't improved in the glass. Right off the rip the aroma is that of rotten steamed vegetables drenched in soy sauce; yuck. For an instant a few wayward hints of toasted, near-burnt bread are noticeable. Way in the back are the faintest notion of caramel.While I cannot fully say it tastes like the aforementioned rotten veggies (though I cannot discount it, either), the prominence of that particular aroma greatly colors my perception of the taste. Upfront is a mellow, slow-to-action bitterness; slightly piney in nature it mostly seems musty &amp; earthy. Notes of burnt caramel &amp; toasted bread are prominent throughout. Murky undertones. Overall, not exactly good. The mouthfeel is standard fare; medium body &amp; appropriate, if slightly low, carbonation. The high point here being how little the feel punctuates the flavor (which seems apt to fail on its own accord). Dirty hints of bitterness &amp; toasted malt linger on the finish; thankfully, not for long.Snapperhead is drinkable in that it isn't totally repulsive. Slight improvement comes as the beer warms. However, I'm greatly unimpressed. I have to wonder about some of the descriptors on the can which make little sense when used for an IPA. If by &quot;all malt&quot; &amp; &quot;farmhouse ale&quot; Beernuts means &quot;we have a negligible understanding of style &amp; make up for questionable beer with high school marketing lingo,&quot; then yeah, I suppose it makes sense.",

The smell has me afraid to take my first sip.T - The bitterness comes through first although it's not as much as you'd expect from a double IPA. Seeing as it comes in at a whopping 10% ABV should prove that this beer has some serious balance issues between the malt and the hops. The taste is not characteristic of the aroma as the hops seem to dominate the malt although slight notes of malt are lingering. Unfortunately, once again, this is all overwhelmed by a nagging alcohol flavor that makes this beer almost undrinkable.

The usual tripartite cream&amp;gt;tan&amp;gt;black colour that slowly becomes all black. Looks very appealing. Sm: Light scent of many notes, but the roast note I'm used to in good stouts is missing. What is there is good, but there ain't much. T: Cream on open turns to an oddly balanced porter without the usual stout roast taste and a strangely empty finish. &quot;Plain&quot; indeed.

        "text": "I thought regular Bud Select was already a light enough beer but apparently not. Bud Select 55 is a very lo-cal beer that is very low in the flavor department.This beer pours a golden color with a fingers worth of fizzy foam that disappears in under 30 seconds. Tons of little fizzy bubbles race to the top of the class, indicating that this will be a very carbonated beer. The brew has that typical Bud Light smell of husky grains, and it also has a tiny bit of skunk for good measure no thanks to the clear glass bottle. The beer almost stings the tongue because of the sharp carbonation level. The beer is unsurprisingly bland and watery. There is a slight husky grain flavor present and a little bit of bitterness in the finish, but I would compare the flavor more to seltzer water than anything. Some dryness lingers on in the finish and the beer has no alcoholic warmth.I think Coors Light might still be a more watery beer, but while Coors just lacks flavor for the most part, Bud Select 55 is almost a chore to drink. It felt like it took me a half hour to finish the bottle. I think the unpleasant mouthfeel really hindered this beer. This is definitely not recommended, even to people who like light beers.",

Unfortunately, everything else about the beer is so vile that I'm going to have to knock down points on appearance.The smell, holy hell.

Bottled 2009.06.12, best before 2009.08.12 according to the label.I was looking forward to a sweet, honey-flavoured citrus-infused lager, but unfortunately this bottle, even though it's fresh from the brewery, is tainted. Not with bacteria, however - the pervasive flavour is none other than sodium metabisulfite (wash fermenters once or twice and you'll never forget this smell).Not sure why - maybe the bottles were hand-washed, and rinsed poorly. This beer is filtered, and apart from the acrid alkali attack on the sinuses, it would otherwise be potable. Hyuganatsu is vaguely detectable, but that's the last sip I'm going to have, this is going down the drain (at least it's good for something)!This was simply a bad bottle - when I next see a bottle of Hyuganatsu I'll give it a second review to be fair. Next, onto the 'Kirinokura Brewery Golden' - I hope the cleaning problems haven't been passed on to all their brews!",

        "text": "First review, but definitely not my first beer by a long shot.Got a bomber of this at my bottle store. I was really excited to see what a pineapple-based beer would taste like.Opened the bottle and immediately knew this was either overcarbed or plain infected since it immediately gushed out although it had been chilling for several days and as far as I know hadn't been jostled or anything like that. Rushed it to the sink to let it sit a while. I recommend opening this beer over your sink because it is seriously overcarbed.Appearance was golden yellow as I expected with crazy amounts of head due to the overcarb. Hazy.Aroma is alright, but if you're looking for the smell of beer you might go elsewhere since this is heavily fruity. You can smell funk from the pineapple. Heavy smell of stale beer, but that's probably due to it spilling all over the place as I rushed it to the sink....Taste is certainly not what I expected as there was basically no malt or hop flavor at all. It reminds me of a pineapple wine more than a beer. Maybe they bottled with champagne yeast or something and it seriously over-attenuated. I liked the taste but I do like champagne and mead and such. I wouldn't specifically buy this for that taste though, I'd get an actual pineapple champagne.Mouthfeel is very light, kind of watery, with excessive carbonation. It really did feel like a watery pineapple champagne.Overall, I would never buy another bottle of this nor would I recommend that anyone else buy it. They have some work to do when it comes to fixing their carbonation issue or stopping the yeast attenuation or whatever went wrong here. Maybe they try to bottle with pineapple juice? This beer needs serious work and should be pulled from the shelves because people are going to get wet with that level of overcarbonation.Edit: Wrote to the brewery because this just didn't feel right. Brewer said this bottle should not have been in the store. So, if you bought one of these recently, you may want to take it back for a refund.",

What can I say about Malta? Well, it is attractively bottled. Carib Brewery says of this beer, &quot;Malta Carib has a pleasant, sweet taste, enhanced by a hint of bitterness derived from hops and is a wholly natural drink made from malted barley containing energy boosting carbohydrates, minerals and proteins all needed for physical well being.&quot; And if you believe all that, I have a great bridge to sell you...To put it bluntly, Malta was the worst beer or beer-like product I have ever tried, and I once ran afoul of a Milwaukee's Best Light! But maybe my review will shed some light on this drink:It pours a dark brown-black and becomes tar black wih a frothy tan-and-khaki head that fades quite fast. The best thing about Malta is its smell, which reminded me of a mocha cappuccino that you might get from Seattle's Best coffee or a second-rate Starbuck's. Malta starts exactly like heavily sweetened and lightly creamed coffee. It tastes (not surprisingly) like coffee and chocolate, thought neither is very pleasing. I thought it had no beer-like flavor or texture at all. Malta is nonetheless full-bodied, and its finish is creamy and a litle like a soft drink. This concoction's aftertaste is heavy and milky in flavor.Perhaps Carib Brewery is right and I've been too harsh on Malta Carib, but if you are ever brave enough to try this drink, don't expect to be reminded of anything but a half-baked stout.",

I guess if I had to describe it, I would say that it was like stale water, with some hoppiness to it. The mouthfeel is somewhat remeniscent of water.

Poured into a ST tulip, a glossy, dark brown color with a slight haze, topped with a cap of off white head; good retention and lacing. All downhill from there. When I first opened the bottle, it actually had a decent aroma somewhat resembling a vinous barleywine. But that quickly turned for the worse. I really don't even know how to accurately describe the horrors of this beer's aroma, but I honestly could not even bring the glass close to my face without throwing up a little in my mouth. Some cloying sweet caramel, grapes, solvent, battery acid, bile...I don't know, rotten raisins maybe? You know that puddle of old flat liquid that pools in the bottom of your bag of recyclables over the course of a week? Maybe that. My palate and all senses were pretty much destroyed at this point, but I held my nose and took a sip. Harsh sulfur, all kinds of cheap booze, varnish, rotten wood, sickeningly sweet rotten fruit. Wow, this was really bad. Not even going to make note of the mouthfeel, because after that one sip, the rest of this went down the drain, and I actually feel bad for my drain because of it.Easily one of the worst beers I've had from the craft scene, and even when compared to some macros.",

Who's the brave soldier then?&quot; I knew I was going to be in for one hell of a ride.A: Not attractive at all. Muddled brown pour with an artificial fluffy E405 head. In many respects, this is reminiscant of raw sewage, if you were ever unlucky enough to have waded through that at some point.S: Good... lord. I can barely describe the disgust that took hold of me as soon as I got the slightest whiff off this beer. The aroma is sickeningly sweet and buttery. A chemical concoction of what chocolate should probably taste like in the mind of a stark-raving mad scientist. Nesquick cocoa powder, yoghurt and raw sugar overpowering anything that could possibly be considered &quot;beery&quot; on the nose. Absolutely vile.T: Sadly I can't go into much further detail about the taste. As it contains so many chemicals, there isn't much nuance to be found between the smell and actual taste. So yeah, it tastes like it smells. Sweet upon sweet with an added touch of sweetness. I couldn't even recognize the malts, hops or anything vaguely beer-related in here.M: I mentioned the buttery character in the nose and this manifests itself in the mouthfeel in a huge way. It somehow manages to feel both incredibly oily and thin. Kinda like the scum on soup, only without the beautiful flavors you usually get from home-made chicken soup. The texture of oil slick along with thin wateriness and low carbonation sent out signals to my body to violently expell this liquid. Gag reflexes at the bar are just not cool.O: Well, Floris Chocolat officially takes the cake as the worst beer I have ever had. I had multiple cheap swill lagers that managed to induce a minor gag reflex, but that are still quite drinkable when heavily chilled and very drunk. This, however, I officially qualify as undrinkable. Sickly sweetness, buttery acidity and an oily mouthfeel make this brew gross beyond all forms of comprehension. The bad memories of a teacher that used to &quot;reward&quot; us with chocolate sweets that had gone off for months suddenly crept back on me, despite me wishing I had surpressed those forever. In case I haven't made myself clear by now: yeah, I'd skip this if I were you.",

I'm unimpressed.There's not a lot to the smell either. A little earthy grains and mild roasting, and slight fruit, but I'm not sure what type. Initial flavor is a mildly roasted, moderately sweet malts with very mild fruit (plum/apple maybe?) and spice undertones. A light touch of earthy hops rounds out the flavor. Alcohol is apparent and a bit too hot for tastes. A bitter/sour flavor carries through the aftertaste. I could have given this beer a passing grade had it not been for this lingering unpleasant flavor. I'm reminded of beers I've had that were &quot;spiced&quot; with spruce. I don't know if Flying Dog used spruce in this, but that's the best way I can describe what I'm detecting in the aftertaste and I don't like it. Mouthfeel and body of K9 is thin and watery for a strong ale like this. I think the carbonation could use some work too. I drank about half of this beer before pouring it down the drain. That's a big deal for me because I can't remember the last time I had a drain pour. Maybe I was just having a bad day, but I would never recommend this anyone.",

The swill in CANs is killing me.Wow! I remember when they first came out with this beer, back in the mid-1990's. The slogan was &quot;Drink Bud Ice, but, uh, beware the penguins.&quot; That was because a menacing little flightless bird showed up in the commercials, terrorizing the crap out of Bud Ice drinkers. For us Pittsburgh Penguins fans, it was a rallying cry for many years until the campaign died, but not before I &quot;procured&quot; a whole buncha Pens stuff through a local distributor, including a necktie, a talking penguin, and best of all, a foam rubber penguin that fits over my head. He lay dormant for many years until this past spring, when in moving out of my parents' house into my new home, I found him in a box of hats! Talk about timing! He accompanied me to Iron Hill (Lancaster) for just about every game of the Pens' Stanley Cup run and routinely got his picture taken as a result.Now, how about the beer? Once again, the bone-white head would begin to form, only to fall away into bare wisps. Was it possible that humidity played a part, or was it just a result of poor brewing? Pheh. Nose had a strange sweetness, like banana candy (think Now &amp; Later or bubble gum), but not in a hefeweizen way. Instead, this just smelled like Dow Chemicals - &quot;Better living through chemistry!&quot; This was not a yeast-driven smell, but instead the construct of some sort of chemical engineering that would render it palatable to the uninitiated. Oof. It sure was pretty to look at, though. It was a deep golden yellow with a clarity that rivaled glass. WAY beyond NE-quality clarity! The mouthfeel was effervescent and tingly - the way the Bath Bomb mentioned on &quot;Weeds&quot; was recommended between the legs in the tub, this had the same effect on the tongue, out of a glass. The taste had some unnatural flavor on the tongue and it never improved as I plowed my way through a 24-oz. CAN. The finish left a dry, cottony taste on my tongue and in my throat. Not unpleasant, but not a desirous quality, either.I'm going to go hug my penguins now (I have a rookery) and try to forget that this debacle ever took place.",

Taste is the same, just couldn't take it.

If you somehow missed reading the back label, they have the same information around the neck of the bottle.

Its smell is that of beautiful green pasture during the spring season that has just been recently been burned by a brush fire. I love (hate) the smell of burning green grass in the morning. Once you get past the smoldering green pasture, a hint of toasted malts with a minuscule aroma of lime comes out from the burnt pasture and into your nose. The taste that came out was grassy (not burned grass, regular grass) with malted wheat, burnt hops, a hint of toasted malt, and with the slightest touch of lime peel and lime leaves. You really need to dig deep to detect any kind of lime flavor in this. The mouthfeel was too watery and thin. You could really taste the fine Colorado Mountain spring water in the mouthfeel. It had an aftertaste of burnt hops with a trace of a salted lime peel. I don't think I could ever drink this one again. It was too thin with an aroma of a burned green pasture.

        "text": "In a review of all 3 BE beers here is the 2nd tasted side by side to its father Velocity IPA. Bottle was released late 2012 or early 2013. No bottle date is on the bottle. It's also listed at 12% abv somehow 2% higher than its father. A: poured out of the bottle into a snifter. Beer pours a murky brown color with a very minimal head. Man this thing is murky. No idea if there is yeast in the bottle but good lord. S: as the same with Velocity, I can smell this thing 3 feet away. All I can smell is bourbon alcohol and booze. It already smells over oaked, bourboned, or whatever you want to call it. I haven't even put it up to my nose yet. Smells like an empty bourbon barrel heavy on the bourbon and wet paper. I'm doing my best to pick out something else but good lord it's all bourbon. There is a cloying sweetness in the nose that I am not looking forward to tasting. No hop aroma to speak of. T: up front bourbon with a hint of bourbon. There are some wood favors in there as well. Some vanilla stands out as the only other description I can find. I can find no Velocity IPA in the taste of this beer. It's hidden behind the booze and bourbon. Again this is a boozy mess with no complexity other than it tastes like bourbon. I would rather just have bourbon. It's sweet and too sweet. The alcohol hides any bitterness and what is left is something that just not for me I guess. M: a think mouthfeel makes for a bad drinking experience. The booze and bourbon stick around for way too long. It's not something I would like and add no complexity to the beer whatsoever ever. Again just drink bourbon. Drink Jack Daniel's as that's what it mostly tastes like. O: honestly I don't know why this exists. It offered zero complexity over it's father Velocity IPA. This could have been any beer and you would have not known due to the fact it tastes like bourbon.",

Poured like translucent mud and tasted like rotten fruit mixed with sour mash.Oh well, maybe next time.",

        "text": "2001 Vintage into a tulip. Cork is very dry and breaks on the way out. Not a good sign. But there is a slight release pf CO2 after pushing the remaining end of cork into the bottle.A - That must have been all the CO2 left, as this pours with absolutely no head Pours a murky brown with a couple cork bits floating on top (which I'll blame on user error).S - Lots of caramel, a bit of cardboard and quite a spice presence. A bit odd overall. Cardboard suggests this is way past it's prime.T - Quite bit tart up front, with a big caramel malt presence. Some fruit: apple, raisin and a bit of cherry. Pretty unpleasant overall. Was hard to drink enough to get the flavor profile.M - Medium mouthfeel and completely flat.O - Well this is clearly way past it's prime. I knew it was a gamble, and it didn't pay off. Drank enough to review and poured the rest. Would love to know what this tastes like fresh.",

This almost has to be a joke. It's one thing to put fruit in beer but to put something like a pepper in it is just crazy. People drink beer to kill the burn of spicy foods not add to it. The aroma and taste of this is just chili pepper. Nothing else.",

The usual lager tastes are present, but very weak.Mouthfeel - Pretty similar to mineral water.Drinkability - It goes down easily, but then again, so does water. Far too boring to session.Overall - For the love of God, stop importing this crap. There are plenty of equally crap beers brewed in your country (unless you are unlucky enough to live in a country with little beer production).",

Delectable.The palate is syrupy and boozy; tons of bacon and maple syrup, maybe even a bit or fried egg. I pick up burning tire and burning alcohol in the mid-palate, and it finishes with diabetes inducing maple syrup sweetness.This is one of the worst beers ever.",

Tastes like they poured a whole jar of honey in one beer!!  Seems like it was made for underaged high school girls.    A very, very poor effort!",

There's not too much aroma to it, a hint of blueberry. The taste is SWEET!! Tastes way too much like cough syrup for a blueberry beer.Ugh, not good at all. Especially trying this one right after a Sea Dog Blueberry Wheat.And definitely not one I would ever buy again... I'll learn from my mistakes and should have consulted beeradvocate beforehand!Edit: Couldn't even finish it... bad.",

It was so bad I felt I had to warn others/communicate to the brewery that they need to work on quality control!It was absolutely foul! As others have said in their reviews, this beer tastes nothing like a German Dunkel. It's salty/sour/vinegary (and not in a good way like with a Gose style). My dad said his bottle tasted fine, but when he tried mine agreed he'd rather drink malt liquor. Had to pour it out (a sin in my book)....man this beer was terrible. There must be a problem at the facility because I can't imagine someone would willingly bottle and sell what I drank.I drank from the bottle so can't speak to color or head. Smell wasn't very appealing either and the body was medium light.",
