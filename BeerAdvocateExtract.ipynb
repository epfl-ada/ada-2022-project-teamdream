    "Our goal for this part is to analyze the textual reviews and see if we can derive insights from them. In particular, we aim at predicting whether a given review has a positive or negative sentiment. We think that by considering the sentiment associated to a review, we can study the popularity of certain beers better than just by looking at the numerical ratings. The intuition behind this is that a textual review is a richer source of information than a rating between 0 and 5. We hope that by leveraging sentiment analysis, we can encapsulate this additional information and use it as an additional measure for beer popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will therefore present a first implementation of a pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Extracts textual reviews from `reviews.txt` into a dataframe\n",
    "        - Annotates the reviews (positive/negative for later training)\n",
    "        - Represents each review in an embedding space\n",
    "        - Trains an SVM classifier on the review embeddings\n",
    "        - Uses the classifier to predict the sentiment of a given review\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use this model to rank beer popularity. A beer is said to more popular than another if its associated reviews have a higher proportion of positively-classified reviews. In particular, we will look at the top 10 countries with highest review output and try to find their most popular beer. As mentioned above, we have yet no reason to believe that this ranking is more \"useful\" than a rating-based ranking, we just want to study to what extent these two are different and then expand on these results in the following milestone. \n",

As a byproduct of the ranking we also generated data collections such as `annotated_reviews`, `most_popular_beers` and `country_indices` that we can use for the final milestone. More importantly we have a new metric for beer popularity that could be used in addition to the numerical ratings to provide a more complete analysis. The next steps in this direction consist in finding the differences between both metrics and if we could combine both into a single indicator of popularity. This indicator would then be used as the final metric of beer popularity. "
